"A","1","Marine habitats","Marine habitats are directly connected to the oceans, i.e. part of the continuous body of water which covers the greater part of the earth¿s surface and which surrounds its land masses. Marine waters may be fully saline, brackish or almost fresh. Marine habitats include those below spring high tide limit (or below mean water level in non-tidal waters) and enclosed coastal saline or brackish waters, without a permanent surface connection to the sea but either with intermittent surface or sub-surface connections (as in lagoons). Rockpools in the supralittoral zone are considered as enclaves of the marine zone. Includes marine littoral habitats which are subject to wet and dry periods on a tidal cycle including tidal saltmarshes; marine littoral habitats which are normally water-covered but intermittently exposed due to the action of wind or atmospheric pressure changes; freshly deposited marine strandlines characterised by marine invertebrates. Waterlogged littoral saltmarshes and associated saline or brackish pools above the mean water level in non-tidal waters or above the spring high tide limit in tidal waters are included with marine habitats. Includes constructed marine saline habitats below water level as defined above (such as in marinas, harbours, etc) which support a semi-natural community of both plants and animals. The marine water column includes bodies of ice.","Hábitats Marinos","Los hábitats marinos se conectan directamente a los océanos, es decir, parte del cuerpo continuo de agua que cubre la mayor parte de la superficie earth¿s y que rodea sus masas de tierra. Las aguas marinas pueden ser totalmente salina, salobre o casi frescos. Los hábitats marinos incluyen aquellos por debajo del límite mareas vivas (o por debajo del nivel del agua en aguas sin mareas significan) y solución salina costera cerrado o aguas salobres, sin una conexión permanente de la superficie del mar, pero cualquiera con conexiones superficiales o subsuperficiales intermitentes (como en lagunas). Rockpools en la zona supralitoral son considerados como enclaves de la zona marina. Incluye hábitats litorales marinos que están sujetos a períodos húmedos y secos en un ciclo de marea incluyendo marismas de marea; hábitats marinos litorales que son normalmente pero intermitentemente expuestas debido a la acción de los cambios de presión atmosférica viento o cubierta de agua; recién depositado strandlines marinos caracterizados por invertebrados marinos. Marismas litorales saturación de agua y solución salina asociado o piscinas de agua salobre por encima del nivel de agua medio en aguas sin mareas o por encima del límite de la marea alta de primavera en aguas de las mareas se incluyen con los hábitats marinos. Incluye construidos hábitats salinos marinos bajo el nivel del agua como se ha definido anteriormente (como en puertos deportivos, puertos, etc.) que soportan una comunidad semi-natural de las plantas y los animales. La columna de agua marina incluye cuerpos de hielo."
"A1","2","Littoral rock and other hard substrata","Littoral rock includes habitats of bedrock, boulders and cobbles which occur in the intertidal zone (the area of the shore between high and low tides) and the splash zone. The upper limit is marked by the top of the lichen zone and the lower limit by the top of the laminarian kelp zone. There are many physical variables affecting rocky shore communities - wave exposure, salinity, temperature and the diurnal emersion and immersion of the shore. Wave exposure is most commonly used to characterise littoral rock, from extremely exposed on the open coast to extremely sheltered in enclosed inlets. Exposed shores tend to support faunal-dominated communities of barnacles and mussels and some robust seaweeds. Sheltered shores are most notable for their dense cover of fucoid seaweeds, with distinctive zones occurring down the shore. In between these extremes of wave exposure, on moderately exposed shores, mosaics of seaweeds and barnacles are more typical.","",""
"A1.1","3","High energy littoral rock","Extremely exposed to moderately exposed or tide-swept bedrock and boulder shores. Extremely exposed shores dominated by mussels and barnacles, occasionally with robust fucoids or turfs of red seaweed. Tide-swept shores support communities of fucoids, sponges and ascidians on the mid to lower shore. Three biological subtypes have been described: Communities on very exposed to moderately exposed upper and mid eulittoral bedrock and boulders dominated by the mussel [Mytilus edulis], barnacles [Chthamalus] spp. and/or [Semibalanus balanoides] and the limpets [Patella] spp. (A1.11); red and brown seaweeds able to tolerate the extreme conditions of exposed rocky shores, primarily the physical stresses caused by wave action (A1.12), and tide-swept shores in more sheltered areas (such as narrow channels in sea loch) with canopy forming fucoids and a rich filter-feeding community (A1.15).","",""
"A1.11","4","Mussel and/or barnacle communities","Communities on very exposed to moderately exposed upper and mid eulittoral bedrock and boulders dominated by the mussel [Mytilus edulis] (A1.111), barnacles [Chthamalus] spp. and/or [Semibalanus balanoides] and limpets [Patella] spp. (A1.112, A1.113). Several variants are identified. Some shores are characterised by dense bands of the barnacle [Semibalanus balanoides] and the limpet [Patella vulgata] (A1.113). The barnacles may be covered by [Porphyra umbilicalis] on the upper shore of exposed sites. Cracks and crevices in the rock provide a refuge for small individuals of the mussel [M. edulis], winkles [Littorina saxatilis] and the whelk [Nucella lapillus]. Red seaweeds also frequently occupy damp crevices, particularly [Ceramium shuttleworthianum], [Corallina officinalis], [Osmundea pinnatifida] and encrusting coralline algae, but the non-vesiculate form of the wrack [Fucus vesiculosus] might be present (A1.1132). Large numbers of the winkle [Littorina littorea] often dominate fields of large boulders or shores with a more mixed substratum (A1.1133). There is much regional variation affecting the zonation of barnacles in the British Isles. In the north-west [C. montagui] and/or [C. stellatus] can form a distinct band above [S. balanoides]. In the south-west [C. montagui] and/or [C. stellatus] can be the dominant barnacles throughout the eulittoral zone (A1.1121). On the east coasts [S. balanoides] is able to extend to the upper shore due to the absence of [Chthamalus] spp. and thereby any competition. The lichen [Lichina pygmaea] may be prominent, especially in the south, where it can form distinct patches or even a separate zone among the [Chthamalus] spp. (A1.1122). In areas of soft rock (e.g. shales), the barnacles may be scarce or absent and the rock dominated by [P. vulgata].Situation: This habitat type is found in the mid to upper eulittoral on very to moderately exposed shores below the lichen dominated biotopes (B3.11) and is typically characterised by patches of mussels [M. edulis] interspersed with barnacles. Below A1.11 is a community dominated by the wrack [Himanthalia elongata] and red seaweeds such as [C. officinalis], [Mastocarpus stellatus] and [O. pinnatifida] (A1.12). With decreasing wave exposure [F. vesiculosus] is able to survive, gradually replacing the barnacles and [P. vulgata] biotope (A1.213). On such moderately exposed shores A1.11 may occur on steep and vertical faces, while fucoids dominate the flatter areas (A1.1132, A1.213).","",""
"A1.111","5","[Mytilus edulis] and barnacles on very exposed eulittoral rock","On very exposed to exposed rocky shores the eulittoral zone, particularly the mid and lower shore, is typically characterised by patches of small individuals of the mussel [Mytilus edulis] interspersed with patches of the barnacle [Semibalanus balanoides] and individuls of the limpet [Patella vulgata]. Amongst the mussels small individuals of red seaweeds including [Ceramium] spp., [Corallina officinalis] and [Mastocarpus stellatus] can be found. The foliose red seaweeds [Porphyra umbilicalis] and [Palmaria palmata] are commonly found as epiphytes on [M. edulis] where they can form luxuriant growths. The abundance of the red seaweeds generally increases down the shore and in the lower eulittoral they may form a distinct zone in which mussels or barnacles are scarce (A1.12, A1.1221 or A1.123). Where [M. edulis] occurs on steep rock, red seaweeds are scarce and restricted to the lower shore. The whelk [Nucella lapillus] and a few winkles such as [Littorina] spp. can occur where cracks and crevices provide a refuge in the rock. Fucoids are generally absent, although some non-vesiculate [Fucus vesiculosus] may occur where the shore slopes more gently. This biotope also occurs on steep moderately exposed shores which experience increased wave energy.Situation: This unit is generally found above a zone of either mixed turf-forming red seaweeds (A1.12), [Himanthalia elongata] (A1.123) or above the sublittoral fringe kelp [Alaria esculenta] (A3.111) zone. Above A1.111 there may be a [Verrucaria maura] zone (B3.1132), a [V. maura] and sparse barnacle zone (B3.1131), often with [P. umbilicalis] or a denser barnacle and limpet zone (A1.113; A1.213). In addition, patches of lichen [Lichina pygmaea] with the barnacle [Chthamalus montagui] (A1.1121) may also occur above this biotope, particularly on southern shores.Temporal variation: Severe winter storms can cause periodic removal of this mussel and barnacle community.","",""

These crevices can also be occupied by encrusting coralline algae and the anemone [Actinia equina]. Black patches of the lichen [Verrucaria maura] may be found in this zone. There is much regional variation in the distribution and zonation of [Chthamalus] spp. On the west coast [Chthamalus] spp. dominate the upper eulittoral, often forming a distinct white band above a darker band of [S. balanoides] in the mid eulittoral zone. [C. montagui] is better adapted to resist desiccation and, therefore, extends further up the shore. On some shores, particularly in the south-west, [Chthamalus] spp. is the dominant barnacle throughout the eulittoral zone (A1.1121).

These features are present throughout the littoral rock zone from the upper limit at the top of of the lichen zone and the lower limit by the top of the laminarian kelp zone. These features can be found on most rocky shores regardless of wave exposure. Lichens can be found in the supralittoral zone on shores with suitable substratum. The lichen band is wider and more distinct on more exposed shores. Rockpools occur where the topography of the shore allows seawater to be retained within depressions in the bedrock producing pools on the retreat of the tide. As these rockpool communities are permanently submerged they are not directly affected by height on the shore and normal rocky shore zonation patterns do not apply allowing species from the sublittoral to survive. Ephemeral seaweeds occur on disturbed littoral rock in the lower to upper shore. The shaded nature of caves and overhangs diminishes the amount of desiccation suffered by biota during periods of low tides which allows certain species to proliferate. In addition, the amount of scour, wave surge, sea spray and penetrating light determines the unique community assemblages found in upper, mid and lower shore caves, and on overhangs on the lower shore. Non-tidal areas irregularly exposed by wind action (hydrolittoral) with hard substrata are also included here.

As these rockpool communities are permanently submerged they are not directly affected by height on the shore and normal rocky shore zonation patterns do not apply. For this reason rockpools have been dealt with as a separate habitat type, apart from the scheme of wave exposure and shore height. Four main rockpool biotopes have been described, and although it is accepted that an enormous variety of rockpool communities exist, it is hoped that these biotope descriptions are broad enough to adequately encompass most types. It would be meaningless to include the characterising species in a description at the habitat type level. Rockpools on the upper shore which are subject to rainwater influence and wide fluctuations in temperature are included in A1.42. Shallow rockpools in the mid to upper shore characterised by encrusting coralline algae and [Corallina officinalis] (A1.411); several variants of these coralline pools occur in south-west Britain and Ireland (A1.4112, A1.4113 and A1.4114). Deeper rockpools on the mid to lower shore can support fucoids and some sublittoral species such as kelp (A1.412). Those rockpools influenced by the presence of sand are characterised by sand-tolerant seaweed such as [Furcellaria lumbricalis] and [Polyides rotundus] (A1.413). Where more stable sand occurs in the base of the rockpool sea-grass beds can occur. Shallow rockpools on mixed cobbles, pebbles, gravel and sand may be characterised by hydroids (A1.414). A very rough guideline to the terms shallow and deep rockpools: shallow rockpools do not support kelp, whereas deep rockpools do.

"A1.44","4","Communities of littoral caves and overhangs","Where caves and overhangs occur on rocky shores, the shaded nature of the habitat diminishes the amount of desiccation suffered by biota during periods of low tides which allows certain species to proliferate. In addition, the amount of scour, wave surge, sea spray and penetrating light determines the unique community assemblages found in upper, mid and lower shore caves and overhangs on the lower shore. Biotopes from the surrounding shore such as A1.111, A1.113 or any of the fucoid communities occasionally extend into cave entrances. A1.113 often extends some way into the cave. Other open shore biotopes may also be found within caves, such as the green seaweed [Prasiola stipitata] on cave roofs where birds roost (B3.112), and localised patches of green algae where freshwater seepage influences the rock (A1.451). Rockpools containing encrusting coralline algae (A1.411), fucoids and kelp (A1.412) and hydroids and littorinid molluscs may occur also on the floor of cave entrances. The cave biotope descriptions are largely based on data obtained from surveys of Berwickshire caves (ERT,2000), chalk caves from the Thanet coast (Tittley et al., 1998; Tittley & Spurrier 2001) and data from Wales (CCW Phase 1 data). In general, the biomass and diversity of algal species found in upper and mid-shore littoral caves decreases with increasing depth into the cave as the light levels diminish. Fucoids are usually only found at the entrances to caves, but red algae, and filamentous and encrusting green algae are able to penetrate to lower light intensities towards the back of the cave, and mats of the turf forming red seaweed [Audouinella purpurea] and/or patches of the green seaweed [Cladophora rupestris] may occur on the upper walls (A1.444). Brownish velvety growths of the brown algae [Pilinia maritima] occurring in mats with the red alga [A. purpurea] on cave walls and upper littoral levels of cliffs (A1.443) should not be confused with the green (A1.442) or golden brown algal stains often found above this zone on the ceilings of the caves (A1.443; A1.441). Below is a zone of [Verrucaria mucosa] and/or [Hildenbrandia rubra] on the inner and outer reaches (A1.445). Fauna usually only occur on the lower and mid walls of the caves and generally comprise barnacles, anemones and tube-forming polychaetes (A1.448; A1.449) depending on the level of boulder scour or wave surge. Where the floors of caves consist of mobile cobbles and small boulders, little algae and fauna occur due to the effects of scouring (A1.44A). Vertical or steeply sloping cave walls and overhangs on the mid and lower shore, subject to wave-surge but without scour, support a rich biota of sponges, hydroids, ascidians and shade-tolerant red algae (A1.447, A1.446 or A1.4461).Situation: Caves and overhangs in the littoral zone in hard rock and limestone (including chalk).","",""

On overhangs, the hydroid [Dynamena pumila] hangs in distinct form from overhanging rock. The barnacles [Balanus crenatus], [Balanus perforatus] (sometimes at high densities) and [Semibalanus balanoides], and the calcareous tube-forming polychaetes [Spirorbis] spp. and [Pomatoceros triqueter] can be present as well. Certain species which are generally confined to the sublittoral, including the anemones [Metridium senile] and [Corynactis viridis], may be found in the lower shore caves and overhangs. Littoral species such as [Actinia equina] are also present. The only algae present are coralline crusts. The list of characterising species partly reflects the variation in the species composition between individual overhangs and caves although this biotope can have a high species richness.Situation: This biotope is found in the lower eulittoral and sublittoral fringe in less wave-surged conditions than that of unit A1.4461.","",""

Increased moisture allows a denser faunal population than unit A1.449 to develop within the cave. The limpet [Patella vulgata] and spirorbid tube-forming polychaetes can be present. The hydroid [Dynamena pumila] and anemones such as [Metridium senile] and [Actinia equina] may occur towards the lower reaches of the cave. Where a dense faunal turf of barnacles or bryozoan crusts covers the cave walls, the biotope can also extend to cover the ceiling and may be accompanied by the bryozoan [Alcyonidium diaphanum].

The isopod [Ligia oceanica] may seek refuge in crevices in the rock, and due to the decreased effect of desiccation in these damp caves, other species such as the anemone [Actinia equina] and spirorbid polychaetes are able to extend further up the shore than normally found on open rock. The lower section of the wall which is subject to greatest scour may be characterised by a band of [Pomatoceros] [triqueter] and spirorbid tube-forming polychaetes.

The rear of caves on the lower shore may support only sparse fauna consisting of spirorbid polychaetes and barnacles such as [Chthamalus montagui] with scattered [Pomatoceros] sp., scattered bryozoan and coralline crusts and in the south-west, occasional [Sabellaria alveolata]. Shade-tolerant red algae such as [Lomentaria articulata] may occasionally occur.

"A2","2","Littoral sediment","Littoral sediment includes habitats of shingle (mobile cobbles and pebbles), gravel, sand and mud or any combination of these which occur in the intertidal zone. Littoral sediment is defined further using descriptions of particle sizes - mainly gravel (16-4 mm), coarse sand (4-1 mm), medium sand (1-0.25 mm), fine sand (0.25-0.063 mm) and mud (less than 0.063 mm) and various admixtures of these (and coarser) grades - muddy sand, sandy mud and mixed sediment (cobbles, gravel, sand and mud together). Littoral sediments support communities tolerant to some degree of drainage at low tide and often subject to variation in air temperature and reduced salinity in estuarine situations. Very coarse sediments tend to support few macrofaunal species because these sediments tend to be mobile and subject to a high degree of drying when exposed at low tide. Finer sediments tend to be more stable and retain some water between high tides, and therefore support a greater diversity of species. Medium and fine sand shores usually support a range of oligochaetes, polychaetes, and burrowing crustaceans, and even more stable muddy sand shores also support a range of bivalves. Very fine and cohesive sediment (mud) tends to have a lower species diversity, because oxygen cannot penetrate far below the sediment surface. A black, anoxic layer of sediment develops under these circumstances, which may extend to the sediment surface and in which few species can survive. Some intertidal sediments are dominated by angiosperms, e.g. eelgrass ([Zostera noltii]) beds on the mid and upper shore of muddy sand flats, or saltmarshes which develop on the extreme upper shore of sheltered fine sediment flats.Situation: Littoral sediments are found across the entire intertidal zone, including the strandline. Sediment biotopes can extend further landwards (dune systems, marshes) and further seawards (sublittoral sediments). Sediment shores are generally found along relatively more sheltered stretches of coast compared to rocky shores. Muddy shores or muddy sand shores occur mainly in very sheltered inlets and along estuaries, where wave exposure is low enough to allow fine sediments to settle. Sandy shores and coarser sediment (gravel, pebbles, cobbles) shores are found in areas subject to higher wave exposures.Temporal variation: Littoral sediment environments can change markedly over seasonal cycles, with sediment being eroded during winter storms and accreted during calmer summer months. The particle size structure of the sediment may change from finer to coarser during winter months, as finer sediment gets resuspended in seasonal exposed conditions. This may affect the sediment infauna, with some species only present in summer when sediments are more stable. These changes are most likely to affect sandy shores on relatively open shores. Sheltered muddy shores are likely to be more stable throughout the year, but may have a seasonal cover of green seaweeds during the summer period, particularly in nutrient enriched areas or where there is freshwater input.","",""
"A2.1","3","Littoral coarse sediment","Littoral coarse sediments include shores of mobile pebbles, cobbles and gravel, sometimes with varying amounts of coarse sand. The sediment is highly mobile and subject to high degrees of drying between tides. As a result, few species are able to survive in this environment. Beaches of mobile cobbles and pebbles tend to be devoid of macroinfauna, while gravelly shores may support limited numbers of crustaceans, such as [Pectenogammarus planicrurus].Situation: Littoral coarse sediments are found along relatively exposed open shores, where wave action prevents finer sediments from settling. Coarse sediments may also be present on the upper parts of shores where there are more stable, sandy biotopes on the lower and mid shore.Temporal variation: The sediment particle size structure may vary seasonally, with relatively finer sediments able to settle during calmer conditions in summer. Where the sediment grain size is very large (at the interface between sediment and boulder shores), cobbles may be mobile during exposed winter conditions, but stable enough during summer months to support limited juvenile rocky shore epifauna (e.g. juvenile barnacles).","",""
"A2.11","4","Shingle (pebble) and gravel shores","Shores of shingle (mobile cobbles and pebbles) or coarse gravel, typically deposited as a result of onshore wave action and long-shore drift. The particle size tends to increase along the shore in the direction of the long-shore drift. As the sediment is very coarse and often quite mobile, it typically supports little marine life, other than opportunist amphipods and oligochaete worms. Summer growths of ephemeral green algae ([Enteromorpha] spp.) may develop.","",""
"A2.111","5","Barren littoral shingle","Shingle or gravel shores, typically with sediment particle size ranging from 4 - 256 mm, sometimes with some coarse sand mixed in. This biotope is normally only found on exposed open coasts in fully marine conditions. Such shores tend to support virtually no macrofauna in their very mobile and freely draining substratum. The few individuals that may be found are those washed into the habitat by the ebbing tide, including the occasional amphipod or small polychaete.Situation: This unit often extends over the whole shore, sometimes extending into the subtidal zone. It may occur on the upper shore above A2.221, and in moderately exposed conditions, above unit A2.223 on the lower shore. Unit A2.211 may occur on the same shore as A2.111, where driftlines of algae and other debris accumulate on the upper shore.Temporal variation: There may be a temporary cover of the green seaweeds [Enteromorpha] spp. or [Ulva] spp. during periods of stability in the summer.","",""
"A2.112","5","[Pectenogammarus planicrurus] in mid shore well-sorted gravel or coarse sand","Shores of well-sorted gravel with a predominant particle size of 4.0 mm but ranging between 3 and 6 mm support dense populations of the amphipod [Pectenogammarus planicrurus]. Material finer than 2 mm reduces the ability of the amphipod to survive. The amphipod is tolerant of variable salinity, although a preference for a specific salinity regime has not been determined. As this habitat is regularly under-surveyed, its distribution is unclear.Situation: The biotope is often associated with the lee side (wind or tide) of obstacles such as rock outcrops and groynes; this may be due to the deposition of algal debris, shelter from wave action or degree of sorting due to localised tidal flow around the obstacle (most likely a combination of the first and last influence).","",""
"A2.12","4","Estuarine coarse sediment shores","Shores of coarse sediments (shingle, gravels and coarse sand) in the upper reaches of estuaries and other inlets (e.g. sealochs) which are subject to variable and reduced salinity conditions.

Shells and stones may occasionally be present on the surface. The sand may be duned or rippled as a result of wave action or tidal currents. Littoral sands exhibit varying degrees of drying at low tide depending on the steepness of the shore, the sediment grade and the height on the shore. The more mobile sand shores are relatively impoverished (A2.22), with more species-rich communities of amphipods, polychaetes and, on the lower shore, bivalves developing with increasing stability in finer sand habitats (A2.23). Muddy sands (A2.24), the most stable within this habitat complex, contain the highest proportion of bivalves.Situation: A strandline of talitrid amphipods (A2.211) typically develops at the top of the shore where decaying seaweed accumulates. Fully marine sandy shores occur along stretches of open coast, whilst muddy sands are often present in more sheltered lower estuarine conditions and may be subject to some freshwater influence.Temporal variation: Littoral sandy shore environments can change markedly over seasonal cycles, with sediment being eroded during winter storms and accreted during calmer summer months. The particle size structure of the sediment may change from finer to coarser during winter months, as finer sediment gets resuspended in seasonal exposed conditions. This may affect the sediment infauna, with some species only present in summer when sediments are more stable. More sheltered muddy sand shores are likely to be more stable throughout the year, but may have a seasonal cover of green seaweeds during the summer period, particularly in nutrient enriched areas or where there is freshwater input.","",""
"A2.21","4","Strandline","The strandline is the shifting line of decomposing seaweed and debris which is typically left behind on sediment (and some rocky shores) at the upper extreme of the intertidal at each high tide. These ephemeral bands of seaweed often shelter communities of sandhoppers. A fauna of dense juvenile mussels may be found in sheltered firths, attached to algae on shores of pebbles, gravel, sand, mud and shell debris with a strandline of fucoid algae.Situation: Strandlines may occur in bands along the upper extreme of any sediment shore and some rocky shores.Temporal variation: Strandlines tend to be mobile, as they consist of driftlines of decomposing seaweed and other debris, which will decompose, and be shifted by the tide. The amount of debris washed up on strandlines, and hence the extent of the strandline, may vary significantly depending on factors such as recent storms or high tides.","",""
"A2.211","5","Talitrids on the upper shore and strandline","A community of sandhoppers (talitrid amphipods) may occur on any shore where driftlines of decomposing seaweed and other debris accumulate on the strandline. The biotope occurs most frequently on medium and fine sandy shores, but may also occur on a wide variety of sediment shores composed of muddy sediment, shingle and mixed substrata, or on rocky shores. The decaying seaweed provides cover and humidity for the sandhopper [Talitrus saltator]. In places on sand that regularly accumulate larger amounts of weed, [Talorchestia deshayesii] is often present. Oligochaetes, mainly enchytraeids, can occur where the stranded debris remains damp as a result of freshwater seepage across the shore or mass accumulation of weed in shaded situations. On shingle and gravel shores and behind saltmarshes the strandline talitrid species tend to be mainly [Orchestia] species. Abundances of the characterising species tend to be highly patchy. Two characterising species lists are presented below. They are derived from two sets of data, which were analysed separately. The first shows data from infaunal samples, the second shows data from epifaunal samples. The epifaunal lists contains no counts per square metre, as the data were collected on the SACFOR scale.Situation: This unit may occur on the same shore as a range of sediment (especially sandy) biotopes, where driftlines of algae and other debris accumulate on the upper shore. These biotopes include units A2.111, A2.221, A2.222, A2.223, and A2.231. The biotope also occurs at the back of boulder, cobble and pebble shores, above mixed sediment and rocky biotopes.Temporal variation: This biotope varies in its position between spring and neap tides, and as a result of changing weather. After storms, it may extend into the fore dunes, during spring tides it will occur high on the shore, and during neaps the greatest numbers of talitrids may be found at or just below MHWN level. The amount of debris washed up on strandlines, and hence the extent of this biotope, may also vary significantly depending on factors such as recent storms or high tides.","",""
"A2.212","5","[Mytilus edulis] and [Fabricia sabella] in littoral mixed sediment","Pebbles, gravel, sand and shell debris with mud in sheltered Firths with a strandline of fucoid algae. The fauna is characterised by juvenile mussels [Mytilus edulis], often in very high numbers. The nemertean worm [Lineus] spp. may be abundant and oligochaetes are common. Polychaetes such as [Pygospio elegans], [Scoloplos armiger] and [Fabricia sabella] may be present in high densities. [Fabricia sabella] is typically found amongst algal holdfasts and between cobbles on rocky shores. The bivalves [Macoma balthica] and [Cerastoderma edule], typical of muddy sediments, characterise the community. The validity of this biotope is uncertain, as the only available data, from the Dornoch Firth and the Moray Firth, are poor. Its position within the classification, as a strandline community, is also very uncertain, but there is not enough information available for a better description or classification at this stage.Situation: Occurs on sheltered shores of the Dornoch Firth and Moray Firth.","",""
"A2.22","4","Barren or amphipod-dominated mobile sand shores","Shores consisting of clean mobile sands (coarse, medium and some fine-grained), with little very fine sand, and no mud present. Shells and stones may occasionally be present on the surface. The sand may be duned or rippled as a result of wave action or tidal currents. The sands are non-cohesive, with low water retention, and thus subject to drying out between tides, especially on the upper shore and where the shore profile is steep. Most of these shores support a limited range of species, ranging from barren, highly mobile sands to more stable clean sands supporting communities of isopods, amphipods and a limited range of polychaetes. Species which can characterise mobile sand communities include [Scolelepis squamata], [Pontocrates arenarius], [Bathyporeia pelagica], [B. pilosa], [Haustorius arenarius] and [Eurydice pulchra].Situation: Mobile sand shores are typically situated along open stretches of coastline, with a relatively high degree of wave exposure. Bands of gravel and shingle may be present on the upper shore of exposed beaches. Where the wave exposure is less, and the shore profile more shallow, mobile sand communities may also be present on the upper part of the shore, with more stable fine sand communities present lower down. A strandline of talitrid amphipods (A2.211) typically develops at the top of the shore where decaying seaweed accumulates.Temporal variation: Mobile sand shores may show significant seasonal changes, with sediment accretion during calm summer periods and beach erosion during more stormy winter months. There may be a change in sediment particle size structure, with finer sediment grains washed out during winter months, leaving behind coarser sediments.","",""
"A2.221","5","Barren littoral coarse sand","Freely-draining sandy beaches, particularly on the upper and mid shore, which lack a macrofaunal community due to their continual mobility.

A2.211may be found on the upper shore where driftlines of wracks and debris accumulate.Temporal variation: Wave exposure may be higher on some beaches during winter than during the summer months, leading to the disappearance of infaunal species in winter.

"A2.223","5","Amphipods and [Scolelepis] spp. in littoral medium-fine sand","Mobile clean sandy beaches on exposed and moderately exposed shores, with sediment grain sizes ranging from medium to fine, often with a fraction of coarser sediment. The sediment contains little or no organic matter, and usually no anoxic layer is present at all. It tends to be well-drained, retaining little water at low tide, though the sediment of the A2.2233 sub-unit may remain damp throughout the tidal cycle. These beaches usually occur under fully marine conditions, though the A2.2232 sub-unit may occur under moderately exposed lower estuarine conditions. The mobility of the sediment leads to a species-poor community, dominated by polychaetes, isopods and burrowing amphipods. [Scolelepis] spp. can tolerate well-drained conditions, and are often present in well-draining, coarser sand. Burrowing amphipods that often occur in this biotope include [Bathyporeia] spp., [Pontocrates arenarius], and [Haustorius arenarius]. The isopod [Eurydice pulchra] is also often present. On semi-exposed beaches with a moderate tide range where there is a marked high-shore berm, there can be a marked seepage at the foot of the berm that probably carries the products of the organic matter derived from strand line breakdown. Here in a narrow zone, exceptionally high populations of [Bathyporeia pilosa], sometimes above 10000 per square metre, may occur. The zone may be narrower than the strandline and could easily be missed on surveys were only a few levels are sampled.

[S. alveolata] can form honeycomb reefs on mid to lower shore on exposed coasts, where there is a plentiful supply of sediment. The underlying substratum may consist primarily of rock or stable cobbles and boulders, or of cobbles and boulders on sand. Mixed sediment shores characterised by beds of adult mussels [Mytilus edulis] occur principally on mid and lower eulittoral mixed substrata (mainly cobbles and pebbles on muddy sediments) in a wide range of exposure conditions. In high densities the mussels bind the substratum and provide a habitat for many infaunal and epifaunal species.Temporal variation: [S. alveolata] reefs may be susceptible to storm damage in the winter, although they can regenerate remarkably quickly in a season as long as some adults are left as they facilitate the larval settlement. [S. alveolata] is tolerant to burial under sand for several weeks. Changes in desiccation over a period of time can cause part of the population to die. One of the mussel-dominated subtypes, A2.7212, could change to A2.7213 over time as pseudofaeces build up forming a layer of mud.

The anemone [Actinia equina] and the crab [Carcinus maenas] can be present in cracks and crevices on the reef. Low abundance of seaweeds tend to occur in areas of eroded reef. The seaweed diversity can be high and may include the foliose red seaweeds [Palmaria palmata], [Mastocarpus stellatus], [Osmundea pinnatifida, Chondrus crispus] and some filamentous species e.g. [Polysiphonia] spp. and [Ceramium] spp. Coralline crusts can occur in patches.

This biotope is also found in lower shore tide-swept areas, such as in the tidal narrows of Scottish sealochs. A fauna of dense juvenile mussels may be found in sheltered firths, attached to algae on shores of pebbles, gravel, sand, mud and shell debris with a strandline of fucoid algae.Situation: High densities of juvenile mussels attached to seaweed have been recorded from sheltered shores of the Dornoch Firth and Moray Firth. Adult mussel beds can be found below a band of ephemeral green seaweeds (A2.821) on more exposed, predominantly rocky shores.

"A2.721","5","Mussel beds on littoral sediments","Dense aggregations of [Mytilus edulis] on the mid and lower shore, on mixed substrata (mainly cobbles and pebbles on fine sediments), on sand, or on sheltered muddy shores. In high densities the mussels bind the substratum and provide a habitat for many infaunal and epifaunal species. The wrack [Fucus vesiculosus] is often found attached to either the mussels or cobbles and it can be abundant. The mussels are often encrusted with the barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides], [Elminius modestus] or [Balanus crenatus]. Where boulders are present they can support the limpet [Patella vulgata]. The winkles [Littorina littorea] and [L. saxatilis] and small individuals of the crab [Carcinus maenas] are common amongst the mussels, whilst areas of sediment may contain the lugworm [Arenicola marina], the sand mason [Lanice conchilega], the cockle [Cerastoderma edule], and other infaunal species. The characterising species list shown below is based on data from epifaunal sampling only. Three sub-biotopes are recognised for this biotope, distinguished principally on the basis of the sediment type associated with the mussel beds. The three types of intertidal mussel beds may be part of a continuum on an axis that is most strongly influenced by the amount of pseudofaeces that accumulate amongst the mussels. The differences may not always be directly connected to the underlying substratum on which the mussel bed may have started a long time ago. It should be noted that there are few data available for the muddy (A2.7213) and sandy (A2.7212) subunits, therefore there are no characterising species lists or comparative tables for these two sub-biotopes.Situation: On more exposed, predominantly rocky shores this biotope can be found below a band of ephemeral green seaweeds (unit A2.821). On sheltered, predominantly rocky shores either a [F. vesiculosus] dominated biotope or a biotope dominated by the wrack [Ascophyllum nodosum] (A1.3132; A1.3142) can be found above or the barnacle dominated biotope (A1.1133). On mudflats and sandflats, this biotope may be found alongside [Cerastoderma edule] beds (A2.242) and other A2.2 and A2.3 biotopes.

"A2.7211","6","Mussel beds on littoral mixed substrata","Mid and lower shore mixed substrata (mainly cobbles and pebbles on fine sediments) in a wide range of exposure conditions and with aggregations of the mussel [Mytilus edulis] colonising mainly the sediment between cobbles, though they can extend onto the cobbles themselves. The mussel aggregations can be very dense and support various age classes. In high densities the mussels bind the substratum and provide a habitat for many infaunal and epifaunal species. The wrack [Fucus vesiculosus] is often found attached to either the mussels or the cobbles and it can occur at high abundance. The mussels are also usually encrusted with the barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides], [Elminius modestus] or [Chtamalus] spp., especially in areas of reduced salinity. The winkles [Littorina littorea] and [L. saxatilis] and small individuals of the crab [Carcinus maenas] are common amongst the mussels, whilst areas of sediment may contain the lugworm [Arenicola marina], the sand mason [Lanice conchilega] and other infaunal species. Pools are often found within the mussel beds that support algae such as [Chondrus crispus]. Where boulders are present they can support the limpet [Patella vulgata], the dogwhelk [Nucella lapillus] and the anemone [Actinia equina]. [Ostrea edulis] may occur on the lowest part of the shore. There are few infaunal samples for this biotope, hence the characterising species list below shows only epifauna. Where infaunal samples have been collected for this biotope, they contain a highly diverse range of species including nematodes, [Anaitides mucosa], [Hediste diversicolor], [Polydora] spp., [Pygospio elegans], [Eteone longa], oligochaetes such as [Tubificoides] spp., [Semibalanus balanoides], a range of gammarid amphipods, [Corophium volutator], [Jaera forsmani], [Crangon crangon], [Carcinus maenas], [Hydrobia ulvae] and [Macoma balthica].Situation: On more exposed, predominantly rocky shores this biotope can be found below a band of ephemeral green seaweeds (unit A2.821).

"A2.7212","6","Mussel beds on littoral sand","This sub-biotope occurs on mid to lower shore sand and muddy sand. Mussels [Mytilus edulis] grow attached to shell debris and live cockles [Cerastoderma edule], forming patches of mussels on consolidated shell material, and often growing into extensive beds. The mussel valves are usually encrusted with barnacles such as [Elminius modestus] and [Semibalanus balanoides], and the mussel bed provides a habitat for a range of species including [Littorina littorea]. The sediment infaunal community is usually rich and very similar to that of cockle beds (A2.242), including cockles [Cerastoderma edule], the baltic tellin [Macoma balthica], and a range of burrowing crustaceans and polychaetes typical for A2.242. Further species may be present are the sand mason [Lanice conchilega], the sand gaper [Mya arenaria], the peppery furrow shell [Scrobicularia plana], [Nephtys] spp., and the ragworm [Hediste diversicolor]. Scattered fronds of eelgrass [Zostera noltii] may occur.Situation: This biotope often occurs in large sandy estuaries, or on enclosed shores, alongside other sand and muddy sand biotopes, most notably unit A2.242. It is possible that Lanice beds (unit A2.245) occur lower down on the shore.Temporal variation: Where this sub-biotope occurs in very sheltered conditions on muddy sand, it could change to A2.7213 over time as pseudofaeces build up forming a layer of mud. This cannot happen where wave action or tidal streams wash away pseudofaeces and prevent a build up.

The mussel valves are usually clean, without epifaunal growth. Where this biotope occurs naturally, all age classes are found within the mussel bed. This biotope also includes commercially laid mussel beds on soft sediments, which tend to be of uniform age structure. The species diversity of this sub-biotope is a lot lower than that of the other A2.721 sub-units.Situation: Occurs on sheltered mudflats, or areas that were previously rocky or cobble fields, but where pseudofaeces have accumulated, leading to the presence of a thick layer of mud.Temporal variation: Mussels may settle on areas of cobble or mixed sediment (unit A2.7211), and lead to the build-up of a thick layer of pseudofaeces, changing the biotope to unit A2.7213 over time.

The kelp [Laminaria digitata] is usually absent, although stunted plants may be present at a few sites. The limpet [Patella vulgata] and the barnacle [Semibalanus balanoides] are often common. Patches of anthozoans and the hydroid [Tubularia] spp. occur in more wave-surged areas. In extremely exposed areas the [A. esculenta] zone can extend as deep as 15 m, where it has less [S. balanoides], [M. edulis] and greater densities of [Tubularia] spp. (e.g. Barra and shallow areas of Rockall, Scotland).Situation: This biotope is most commonly found beneath the mussel-barnacle zone (unit A1.111) of very exposed shores and above the upper infralittoral [Laminaria hyperborea] forest (  A3.113 or A3.115). It is at the extremely wave-surged sites, such as St Kilda, that A3.113 occurs below A3.1111.

Also found on the stipes or on the rock below the canopy are red seaweeds including [Phycodrys rubens], [Kallymenia reniformis], [Callophyllis laciniata, Caryophyllia smithii], and [Corallina officinalis], while encrusting coralline algae can cover any bare patches of rock. At some sites the red seaweeds can be virtually mono-specific, while at other sites show considerable variation containing a dense mixed turf of a large variety of species. The red seaweed [Odonthalia dentata] can be present in the north. The faunal and floral under-storey is generally rich in species due, in part, to the relatively low urchin-grazing pressure in such shallow exposed conditions. The faunal composition of this biotope varies markedly between sites, but commonly occurring are the soft coral [Alcyonium digitatum] and the anthozoans [Sagartia elegans] and [Corynactis viridis]. Sponges form a prominent part of the community with variable amounts of the sponges [Halichondria panicea] and [Pachymatisma johnstonia] and several other species. The crab [Cancer pagurus] and the starfish [Asterias rubens] are normally present in small numbers foraging beneath the canopy, while the sea urchins [Echinus esculentus] and [Urticina felina] graze on the seaweeds.

Three variations of this biotope are described: the upper infralittoral kelp forest (unit A3.1151), the kelp park below (unit A3.1152) and a third type of kelp forest, confined to southern England, that is characterised by a mixture of [L. hyperborea] and [Laminaria ochroleuca] (unit A3.1153). The fauna of these biotopes is markedly less abundant than kelp forests in areas of greater wave surge (unit A3.113); sponges, anthozoans and polyclinid ascidians may be present, though never at high abundance. Beneath the under-storey of red seaweeds, the rock surface is generally covered with encrusting coralline algae.","",""
"A3.1151","6","[Laminaria hyperborea] forest with dense foliose red seaweeds on exposed upper infralittoral rock","Very exposed to exposed upper infralittoral bedrock or large boulders characterised by a dense forest of the kelp [Laminaria hyperborea]. On the rock surface beneath the kelp canopy is a dense turf of red foliose seaweeds including [Cryptopleura ramosa], [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Phycodrys rubens] and [Callophyllis laciniata] as well as encrusting coralline algae and the foliose brown seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma]. The red algal turf can be virtually mono-specific, dominated by stands of [P. cartilagineum], [C. ramosa] or [Heterosiphonia plumosa], [Kallymenia reniformis] or in the north, [Odonthalia dentata]. Other sites may contain a dense mixed turf of these and other species. The dense turf is due, in part, to the relatively low grazing pressure from the urchin [Echinus esculentus] in such shallow exposed conditions. The shallowest kelp plants are often short or stunted, while deeper plants are taller and the stipes are heavily epiphytised by red seaweeds such as [Delesseria sanguinea] and [Membranoptera alata]. The bryozoan [Electra pilosa] can form colonies on the foliose red seaweeds, while the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] more often can be found on the [L. hyperborea] fronds along with the ascidian [Botryllus schlosseri] and the hydroid [Obelia geniculata]. The gastropods [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum] are found grazing among the kelp holdfasts, while a few individuals of the barnacle [Balanus crenatus] can present along with the white calcareous tubes of the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter], where substratum is available. The starfish [Asterias rubens] can be found predating on polychaetes, mussels and small crustaceans. The soft coral [Alcyonium digitatum] can be present covering the rock surface as well as the anthozoan [Urticina felina].Situation: This kelp forest biotope most commonly occurs beneath a zone of [Alaria esculenta/Mytilus edulis] (unit A3.1111) and above a [L. hyperborea] park (unit A3.1152). At very exposed sites, such as some areas of Shetland and St Kilda, the lower infralittoral zone is often characterised by a park of [Laminaria saccharina] and/or [Saccorhiza polyschides] (A3.122). This zone presumably develops due to the mobility of nearby cobbles, boulders and sediment during winter storms, removing the slower growing [L. hyperborea]. Occasionally, a band of dense foliose seaweeds, with no kelp, occurs below the kelp forest (units A3.116 or A3.1161).","",""

These red seaweeds dominate kelp stipes and bedrock in a similar abundance and composition to the upper infralittoral kelp forest, the most commonly occurring species being [Callophyllis laciniata], [Cryptopleura ramosa], [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Kallymenia reniformis], [Delesseria sanguinea], [Phycodrys rubens], [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides], [Heterosiphonia plumosa] and [Bonnemaisonia asparagoides]. In addition, moderate to high abundance of foliose brown seaweeds, such as [Dictyota dichotoma] are more common than in the kelp forest above. More upper circalittoral fauna occur in the park than in the kelp forest, such as the cup-coral [Caryophyllia smithii]. Some species more often present in the kelp park than the forest include the anthozoan [Alcyonium digitatum] and the featherstar [Antedon bifida]. The urchin [Echinus esculentus], the gastropods [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and the starfish [Asterias rubens] are normally present underneath the canopy along with the anthozoans [Urticina felina] and [Corynactis viridis]. The sponge [Cliona celata] is also present often found boring into shells or soft rock where available. The bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] can be found on the [L. hyperborea] fronds along with the hydroid [Obelia geniculata] and the ascidian [Botryllus schlosseri].

[L. hyperborea] has a rough stipe which allow dense assemblages of epiphytic red seaweeds to form including the foliose [Callophyllis laciniata], [Delesseria sanguinea] and [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides]. Unlike [L. hyperborea], however, [L. ochroleuca] has a smooth stipe and so it lacks dense assemblages of epiphytic seaweeds [L. ochroleuca] has a smooth stipe. Encrusting coralline algae often cover much of the rock surface along with a few brown seaweeds including [Dictyota dichotoma], [Dictyopteris polypodioides] and [Desmarestia aculeata] present as well. In mixed kelp forest [L. ochroleuca] may predominate with [L. hyperborea] more common at shallower depths. Whilst foliose red seaweeds dominate the upward-facing rock beneath the kelp canopy, much of the fauna is restricted to crevices or vertical faces, possibly due to grazing pressure. Echinoderms are often common in this biotope, in particular the sea urchin [Echinus esculentus] and the starfish [Asterias rubens] and [Marthasterias glacialis]. Verticals are colonised by anthozoans including the anthozoans [Corynactis viridis], [Caryophyllia smithii, Actinothoe sphyrodeta] and [Alcyonium digitatum], while the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] colonise the [Laminaria] sp. fronds. This biotope is restricted to the coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. [L. ochroleuca] occurs at low abundance in other kelp biotopes (sheltered through to exposed) from Dorset to Lundy Island. In such cases, records should be treated as regional variations of these biotopes. Records should only be assigned to this unit when the canopy is dominated by [L. ochroleuca] alone, or (more usually) by a mixture of both [L. hyperborea] and [L. ochroleuca] (at similar abundance). Both this biotope and unit A3.311 are common on the Brittany and Normandy coasts of France.Situation: Since [L. ochroleuca] is less tolerant of wave action than [L. hyperborea] this biotope commonly occurs below exposed kelp forests (unit A3.1151). On occasion it is found below [Alaria] [esculenta] in the sublittoral fringe (units A3.1111 or A3.1112).

Most of the red seaweeds are common to the kelp zone above, while the faunal component of the biotope is made up of species that are found either in the kelp zone or the animal-dominated upper circalittoral below. Foliose species commonly present include [Dilsea carnosa], [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Schottera nicaeensis], [Cryptopleura ramosa] and [Delesseria sanguinea]. The red seaweed species composition varies considerably; at some sites a single species may dominate (particularly [Plocamium cartilagineum]). Small filamentous red seaweeds can be found here as well. These include species such as [Heterosiphonia plumosa, Brongniartella byssoides]. As well as a varied red seaweed component, this biotope may also contain occasional kelp plants and patches of the brown foliose seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma]. Coralline crusts covers the bedrock beneath the seaweeds. The fauna generally comprises low-encrusting forms such as the tubeworms [Pomatoceros] spp., anthozoans including [Alcyonium digitatum], [Urticina felina] and [Caryophyllia smithii]) and occasional sponge crusts such as [Cliona celata, Esperiopsis fucorum], [Scypha ciliata] and [Dysidea fragilis]. More mobile fauna include the gastropod [Calliostoma zizyphinum], the echinoderms [Echinus esculentus] as well as the starfish [Asterias rubens] and [Marthasterias glacialis] and lastly, the crab [Cancer pagurus]. Bryozoan crusts such as [Electra pilosa] can be found fronds on the foliose red seaweeds while scattered hydroids such as [Nemertesia antennina] form colonies on shells, cobbles and available rock. At some sites erect bryozoans [Crisia] spp. and [Bugula] spp. are present. Ascidians such as [Clavelina lepadiformis] and [Clavelina lepadiformis] may also be common. In the north the foliose red seaweed [Callophyllis laciniata] may occur.Situation: This biotope is generally found at or below the lower limit of the kelp, below either kelp forest or park (units A3.1151 and A3.1152).Temporal variation: Many of the red seaweeds, which occur in this biotope, have annual fronds, which tend to die back in the autumn and regenerate again in the spring.

In some areas the lower infralittoral is subject to a moderate amount of scour from nearby sand. [D. dichotoma] is relatively tolerant of such scour and in such areas a zone forms with other sand-tolerant seaweeds. [D. membranacea] is confined to south-western coasts. Typically brown seaweeds dominate the seabed or are at least in equal abundance to the red seaweeds, some of which may also form dense stands such as [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Calliblepharis ciliata, Cryptopleura ramosa, Bonnemaisonia asparagoides], [Heterosiphonia plumosa, Delesseria sanguinea] and [Brongniartella byssoides]. The urchin [Echinus esculentus] can be found grazing the rock surface which can be covered in coralline algae. The anthozoans [Caryophyllia smithii] and [Alcyonium digitatum] are usually present in this biotope along with the tube-building worm [Pomatoceros] sp. which is more common in sand-scoured areas. The starfish [Asterias rubens] and [Henricia] sp. and sponge crusts including [Cliona celata] can also be found here. [D. dichotoma] also occurs in the kelp park, and records should only be assigned to this biotope where kelp such as [Laminaria hyperborea] is sparse or absent and a relatively high density of [D. dichotoma] and/or [D. membranacea] is present.Situation: This biotope usually occurs at or below the lower limit of kelp [L. hyperborea] (units A3.1152 or A3.214). In south-west England a zone of mixed kelp forest [L. hyperborea] and [Laminaria ochroleuca] may occur above the dense foliose algae (unit A3.1153). Unit A3.1161 marks the lower limit of the lower infralittoral zone.Temporal variation: Like many of the red seaweeds found in this biotope the dominant brown seaweeds [D. membranacea] and [D. dichotoma] have annual fronds which tend to die back in the autumn and regenerate again in the spring. This produces a seasonal change in the density of the seaweed cover, which is substantially reduced over winter months and reaches its most dense between April and September.","",""

Within this biotope the jewel anemone [Corynactis viridis] is frequently found in dense aggregations attached to the vertical rock surface. This biotope contains 5 sub-biotopes, distinguished by their biogeography. On the west coast of Scotland, the Northern Isles and the Isle of Man on extremely exposed coasts a variant of this biotope characterised by frequent [Metridium senile] and occasional [Sagartia elegans] can be found. Further south on the west coast of Ireland, southern Scotland, Wales, and south west England a second variant characterised by frequent [Alcyonium digitatum] and occasional [Cliona celata] can be distinguished. A third variant has been recorded from Northern Ireland characterised by the red seaweeds [Lithophyllum] and [Ptilota gunneri], the sea squirt [Dendrodoa grossularia] and the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea]. South from the Isle of Man, on the Welsh Coast, and on the south west and southern English coasts a fourth variant of this biotope is found, which is characterised by the barnacle [Balanus crenatus], which may be more frequent in this sub-biotope, and the rarity of [Alcyonium digitatum], a species which is more frequent in other variants. This variant has mainly been recorded in shallow water (0-5m). The final biogeographic variant of this biotope is, as with the previous variant, found on the coasts of Wales and south west England.

The associated communities can be quite variable in character, depending on the particular conditions, which prevail. The typical [Laminaria hyperborea] and red seaweed communities of stable open coast rocky habitats (A3.21) are replaced by those, which include more ephemeral species or those tolerant of sand and gravel abrasion. As such [Laminaria saccharina], [Saccorhiza polyschides] or [Halidrys siliquosa] may be prominant components of the community.","",""
"A3.121","5","[Saccorhiza polyschides] and other opportunistic kelps on disturbed upper infralittoral rock","Exposed low-lying reefs in the sublittoral fringe or upper infralittoral (generally above 5m depth), mainly in the southwest and west, dominated by the kelp [Saccorhiza polyschides]. This opportunistic coloniser replaces [Laminaria digitata] or [Laminaria hyperborea] as the dominant kelp, following disturbance of the canopy. This may be the result of storms, when loose sediment and even cobbles or boulders are mobilised, scouring most seaweeds and animals from the surrounding rock. As [S. polyschides] is essentially a summer annual (occasionally it lasts into a second year), it is also particularly common close to rock/sand interfaces which become too scoured during winter months to prevent the longer-living kelps from surviving. As a result of the transient nature of this biotope, its composition is varied; it may contain several other kelp species, including [L. digitata], [Laminaria saccharina] and [Alaria esculenta], at varying abundances. [Laminaria] spp. sporelings can also be a prominent feature of the site. Beneath the kelp, (scour-tolerant) red seaweeds including [Corallina officinalis], [Kallymenia reniformis], [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Chondrus crispus], [Dilsea carnosa] and encrusting coralline algae are often present. Foliose red seaweeds such as [Callophyllis laciniata], [Cryptopleura ramosa] and [Palmaria palmata] also occur in this biotope. [P. palmata] and [Delesseria sanguinea] often occur as epiphytes on the stipes of [L. hyperborea], when it is present. The foliose green seaweed [Ulva] spp. is fast to colonise newly cleared areas of rock and is often present along with the foliose brown seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma]. Due to the disturbed nature of this biotope, fauna are generally sparse, being confined to encrusting bryozoans and/or sponges, such as [Halichondria panicea] and the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria].Situation: On some shores (for example in Cornwall and south-west Ireland), [S. polyschides] competes so effectively with the other laminarians that it forms a well-defined zone in shallow water, between the [L. digitata] (unit A3.3131) and [L. hyperborea] zones (units A3.115 and A3.214). Elsewhere, it is found at sites that have been physically disturbed, removing areas of established kelp ([L. hyperborea]) thus allowing this opportunistic biotope to develop over a short space of time.Temporal variation: There may be significant variations in this biotope over time, as by its very nature, it is dominated by many fast-growing annual seaweeds. The foliose green seaweed [Ulva] sp. is fast to colonise newly cleared areas of rock and can be present as a dense growth on the rock around the [Saccorhiza polyschides]. Similarly, large patches of [Laminaria] spp. sporelings may be present at times.","",""
"A3.122","5","[Laminaria saccharina] and/or [Saccorhiza polyschides] on exposed infralittoral rock","A forest or park of the fast-growing, opportunistic kelps [Laminaria saccharina] and/or [Saccorhiza polyschides] often occurs on seasonally unstable boulders or sand/pebble scoured infralittoral rock. The substratum varies from large boulders in exposed areas to smaller boulders and cobbles in areas of moderate wave exposure or nearby bedrock. In these cases, movement of the substratum during winter storms prevents a longer-lived forest of [Laminaria hyperborea] from becoming established. This biotope also develops on bedrock where it is affected by its close proximity to unstable substrata. Other fast-growing brown seaweeds such as [Desmarestia viridis], [Desmarestia aculeata, Cutleria multifida] and [Dictyota dichotoma] are often present. Some [L. hyperborea] plants may occur in this biotope, but they are typically small since the plants do not survive many years. The kelp stipes are usually epiphytised by red seaweeds such as [Delesseria sanguinea] and [Phycodrys rubens]. Other red seaweeds present beneath the kelp canopy include [Plocamium cartilagineum, Nitophyllum punctatum], [Callophyllis laciniata] and [Cryptopleura ramosa]. Encrusting algae often form a prominent cover on the rock surfaces, including red, brown and coralline crusts. Faunal richness and diversity is generally low compared to the more stable [L. hyperborea] kelp forest and park communities (A3.115). Where some protection is afforded the anthozoan [Alcyonium digitata] can occur in addition to the more robust species such as the tube-building worm [Pomatoceros triqueter]. Mobile species include the to shell [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and the sea urchin [Echinus esculentus]. The hydroid [Obelia geniculata] and the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] can often be found colonising the kelp fronds.Situation: This biotope can be found below the [L. hyperborea] zone (units A3.113 or A3.115), especially where close to a rock/ sand interface (where it is subject to sand/pebble scour in winter). Where this biotope occurs on bedrock, not scoured by mobile sediment, it is thought to occur as a result of intense wave action in winter storms which is too severe to allow [L. hyperborea] to develop and remain in shallow water.Temporal variation: Due to the disturbed nature of this biotope there can be significant changes in the structure of the community. Coralline and brown algal crusts with sparse kelp plants generally dominate areas that have been recently disturbed. Diversity is low and a few species of fast-growing seaweeds can dominate the seabed. A longer established community will have larger, mixed kelp plants and a greater diversity of red seaweeds.","",""
"A3.123","5","[Laminaria saccharina], [Chorda filum] and dense red seaweeds on shallow unstable infralittoral boulders and cobbles","Seasonally disturbed unstable boulders and cobbles in very shallow water dominated by the fast-growing brown seaweed [Chorda filum] together with the kelp [Laminaria saccharina]. The brown seaweed [Desmarestia aculeata] is also typical of this disturbed environment as well encrusting coralline algae and brown crusts. Beneath the prolific growth of [C. filum], red and brown seaweeds densely cover many of the boulders, cobbles and pebbles. Other sediment-tolerant seaweeds such as species from the Ectocarpales (brown filamentous seaweeds) and the red seaweeds [Chondrus crispus], [Phyllophora pseudoceranoides], [Dilsea carnosa] and [Corallina officinalis] is normally present. Other red seaweeds which can be found here include [Chondria dasyphylla], [Brongniartella byssoides], [Polysiphonia elongata], [Ceramium nodolosum], [Cystoclonium purpureum, Heterosiphonia plumosa], [Rhodomela confervoides] and [Plocamium cartilagineum]. The brown seaweeds [Punctaria] sp. and [Cladostephus spongiosus] are generally present. The faunal component of this biotope is typically sparse - the starfish [Asterias rubens] and the crabs [Pagurus] [bernhardus] and [Necora puber] are amongst the most conspicuous animals. The bryozoan crust [Electra pilosa] colonise many of the algae along with the ascidian [Botryllus schlosseri]. Occasional the polychaete [Lanice conchilega] may occur in the sand between pebbles, and the anthozoan [Urticina felina] may be found amongst pockets of gravel along with the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria]. At some sites the rock beneath the algae can be occupied by the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter]. This biotope is also present at other open coast sites around the UK where suitable shallow, seasonally stable boulders, cobbles and pebbles occur. Typical examples of this biotope occur on the shallowest areas of the Sarns in Cardigan Bay, Wales, where reef crests are formed by embedded and mobile boulders, together with cobbles and pebbles in between (typically at 2-3m depth).Situation: This biotope occurs in shallow water, often on the crest of an infralittoral boulder/cobble bank and as such will not have any biotope above it. More mobile areas of smaller boulders, cobbles and pebbles nearby may support dense ephemeral red seaweeds (unit A2.82) or robust scour-tolerant red seaweeds on sand-covered rock (unit A3.127). The [Halidrys siliquosa] biotope (unit A3.126) also thrives under similar conditions, extending deeper than the shallow A3.123 biotope. Deeper still in the circalittoral zone encrusting fauna is found on highly mobile mixed substrata (A5.141). At a few sites, this biotope can occur within more extensive maerl beds (A5.51) but more commonly is surrounded by sandy sediments (A5.2).Temporal variation: This biotope will change markedly with the seasons. During the winter months boulders and cobbles will be storm battered and overturned and much of the biota dislodged from the rocks. During more stable conditions in the late spring and summer months the fast-growing seaweeds that characterise this biotope ([C. filum] and [L. saccharina] in particular) will be quick to re-establish, growing at a phenomenal rate. The seasonal disturbance of the substratum prevents a stable [Laminaria hyperborea] forest from developing.","",""

Infralittoral pebbles and cobbles that are scoured through mobility during storms, but become stable in the summer allowing the growth of such algae as [Desmarestia] spp. Filamentous red seaweeds such [as Bonnemaisonia asparagoides] and [Brongniartella byssoides] are usually present. Stunted individuals of the kelp such as [Laminaria hyperborea] and [Laminaria saccharina] may be present where bedrock is available.

The perennial red seaweed [Brongniartella byssoides] re-grows in the summer months. The [L. hyperborea] stipes often support a growth of epiphytes, such as [Delesseria sanguinea], [Phycodrys rubens] and [Cryptopleura ramosa]. The scour can reduce the rock surface to bare coralline crusts at times; sponge crusts and the colonial ascidian [Botryllus schlosseri] can also grow on the stipes and holdfasts. The faunal diversity on the rock is usually low and restricted to robust, low-profile animals such as the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter], the barnacle [Balanus crenatus], encrusting bryozoans such as [Membranipora membranacea], the anthozoan [Urticina felina], the starfish [Asterias rubens] and the urchin [Echinus esculentus]. Deeper sites support more hydroids and bryozoans, particularly [Bugula] spp. Where this biotope occurs in very shallow water [Laminaria digitata] may be found in combination with the other kelp species. Other species present only in shallow water include the red algae [Corallina officinalis] and the sand-binding alga [Rhodothamniella floridula].Situation: This biotope often occurs below a [L. hyperborea] forest (unit A3.1151, A3.2141 or A3.2121), close to a rock-sediment boundary.

A [Flustra foliacea] community (A4.134) often dominates deeper sand-scoured circalittoral rock.Temporal variation: During late autumn and winter seaweeds are sparse, leaving predominantly kelp and encrusting coralline algae. This is due in part to periods of intense scouring during stormy months, which may strip off all but the most tenacious seaweeds. In addition there will be the natural die back of many of the seaweeds such as [B. byssoides] and [C. ciliata] during the winter months which become conspicuous again during the summer months.","",""

Kelp stipes are usually covered in a rich mixture of red seaweeds of which [Palmaria palmata], [Phycodrys rubens] and [Membranoptera alata] are often present. Small kelp plants can also be found on the larger kelp stipes. Kelp fronds may be covered with a hydroid growth of [Obelia geniculata] or the bryozoans [Membranipora membranacea] and [Electra pilosa]. The kelp holdfasts can be colonised by bryozoans [Scrupocellaria] spp. and/or crisiids and colonial ascidians such as [Botryllus schlosseri]. The rock surface between the kelp plants is generally covered by encrusting coralline algae, often with sponge crusts [Halichondria panicea]. Small vertical surfaces within the kelp forest generally lack kelp plants, instead being characterised by foliose red seaweeds such as [Dictyota dichotoma], the anthozoans [Alcyonium digitatum, Urticina felina] and [Caryophyllia smithii], the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] and gastropods including [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and [Gibbula cineraria]. Many grazers are found in the kelp forest, the most commonly occurring being the gastropods [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and the echinoderm [Echinus esculentus]. Other echinoderms present include [Asterias rubens] and [Antedon bifida] which can be locally abundant, particularly in the north-west.Situation: This biotope occurs over a wide geographic area and is generally found below the sublittoral fringe [Laminaria digitata] zone (unit A3.3131) and above the [L. hyperborea] park (unit A3.2142). In the north, Shetland in particular, unit A3.122 can occur in the lower infralittoral; where grazing influence is present the abundance of red seaweeds may be much reduced (unit A3.2144). In turbid water kelp park is often absent and dense foliose seaweed cover may occur instead (unit A3.215). In areas affected by scour, such as the rock-sediment interface at the base of bedrock slopes, a mixed kelp canopy can develop below the kelp forest (unit A3.125).Temporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. Otherwise this biotope is not known to vary markedly over time. Certain areas are prone to urchin grazing and this can substantially alter the community structure of the biotope, such that any site subject to intensive urchin grazing should be recorded as unit A3.2143.","",""
"A3.2142","6","[Laminaria hyperborea] park and foliose red seaweeds on moderately exposed lower infralittoral rock","Below the dense kelp forest (unit A3.2141) on moderately exposed lower infralittoral bedrock and boulders, the kelp thins out to form a park. Beneath the kelp, the rock and kelp stipes are covered by an often dense turf of foliose red seaweeds such as [Callophyllis laciniata], [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Delesseria sanguinea, Hypoglossum hypoglossoides, Cryptopleura ramosa, Callophyllis laciniata] and [Phycodrys rubens]. Coralline crusts are often present on the rock surface. Many species of red seaweed found in this biotope occur at greater abundance in the shallower kelp forest. Other seaweeds, such as the red seaweeds [Bonnemaisonia asparagoides] and [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides] as well as the brown seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma] are more abundant in this zone than the upper infralittoral. The faunal component of this biotope is similar to that found below the kelp in the upper infralittoral zone and include the hydroid [Obelia geniculata], the ascidian [Clavelina lepadiformis], the anthozoans [Urticina felina, Alcyonium digitatum] and [Caryophyllia smithii], the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] and the gastropods [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and [Gibbula cineraria]. The gastropods [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and the echinoderm [Echinus esculentus] can be found grazing on the rock. Other echinoderms present include [Asterias rubens] and [Antedon bifida] which can be locally abundant, particularly in the north-west.Situation: This biotope generally occurs below [L. hyperborea] forest (unit A3.2141) and marks the lower limit of the infralittoral rock. Occasionally a narrow band of foliose seaweeds (unit A3.116) may occur below the kelp park but generally circalittoral biotopes are found.Temporal variation: The under-storey of foliose and filamentous seaweeds will diminish towards the autumn and regrow in the spring. When grazing urchins (predominantly [E. esculentus]) reach a large number in the kelp park their voracious grazing can substantially alter the community structure of the biotope, removing most of the seaweeds and leaving only coralline crusts on the rock. This is common around the coast of Scotland, particularly in Shetland and such sites should be recorded as unit A3.2143.","",""
"A3.2143","6","Grazed [Laminaria hyperborea] forest with coralline crusts on upper infralittoral rock","Exposed to moderately exposed [Laminaria hyperborea] forest is in some areas intensely grazed by the urchin [Echinus esculentus]. The rock surface lacks a significant turf of foliose seaweeds and generally looks bare, though encrusting algae cover the rock. In addition to these encrusting coralline algae, non-calcareous crusts such as [Cruoria pellita] and brown algal crusts also occur. The kelp stipes may or may not be grazed; in the most extremely grazed areas, the stipes are also devoid of seaweeds. More usually, however, the stipes offers a refuge from grazing, and are characterised by dense turfs of red seaweeds, especially [Phycodrys rubens, Callophyllis laciniata, Plocamium cartilagineum] and [Delesseria sanguinea]. The hydroid [Obelia geniculata] and the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] colonise the kelp fronds. On the rock itself certain brown seaweeds such as [Cutleria multifida] may persist in this grazed environment. Fast-growing species such as the kelp [Laminaria saccharina] may be present at sites recovering from grazing, opportunistically colonising the rock surfaces that have been cleared by grazing. The fauna within a grazed kelp forest is also relatively sparse and is mostly confined to cracks, crevices and under-boulders. Species such as the ascidian [Clavelina lepadiformis] can often be found on vertical rock. Also found on the rock surface are the anthozoans [Urticina felina] and [Alcyonium digitatum]. Encrusting species such as the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] are resistant to grazing and may occur in abundance. The grazers present include the echinoderm [Echinus esculentus] and the gastropods [Calliostoma zizyphinum] and [Gibbula cineraria]. Other echinoderms present include [Asterias rubens] and [Antedon bifida] which can be abundant in the north-west. Moderate grazing occurs within many kelp forests; records should only be assigned to this biotope where the community has been intensively grazed leaving algal-encrusted rock with very few epilithic algae.Situation: With increasing depth, the kelp forest grades into a grazed kelp park (unit A3.2144), the lower limit of which is often abrupt, representing the balance point between urchin-grazing pressure and kelp growth capabilities. In wave-exposed steep rocky areas, the shallowest water may be characterised by a forest of kelp with red seaweeds (unit A3.1151), with a grazed kelp forest beneath. This effect may be a result of the increased wave action in shallower water, which regularly dislodges the urchins thereby reducing their grazing impact. This unit is prevalent in the north of the UK where [E. esculentus] populations reach high densities. Although [E. esculentus] is widely distributed around the UK it occurs in greatest abundance in Scotland and north-east England where urchin grazing can substantially affect infralittoral communities.Temporal variation: Fluctuations in [E. esculentus] numbers may give foliose seaweeds a chance to re-grow periodically. Further information is required on the temporal variation within these grazed forests and the changes in community structure when grazing pressure decreases.","",""

Red seaweeds such as [Plocamium cartilagineum] and [Delesseria sanguinea] may also be found beneath the kelp canopy, although typically low in abundance. They can be colonised by the ascidian [Botryllus schlosseri]. The cowrie [Trivia arctica] can also be found here. Much of the available rock is covered with encrusting coralline algae together with patches of the encrusting sponge [Halichondria panicea] and the anthozoan [Urticina felina]. More mobile fauna include the echinoderms [Asterias rubens, Henricia sanguinolenta, Echinus esculentus], and [Ophiothrix fragilis], the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria] and the hermit crab [Pagurus bernhardus]. The scouring effect of mobile sand adjacent to the rock maintains a reduced underflora and fauna compared to the association of species found in non-scoured kelp forests (unit A3.2141). Scour-resistant fauna such as the barnacle [Balanus crenatus] can be locally abundant on the rock, while the bivalve [Pododesmus patelliformis] can be found seeking shelter underneath the cobbles. Above the effect of scour, kelp stipes may be densely colonised by red seaweeds such as [Phycodrys rubens], [Palmaria palmata] and [Membranoptera alata], together with some sponges and ascidians.Situation: This biotope is found in the sand-laden waters of north-east England in conditions in which [S. spinulosa] is able to thrive. Nearby circalittoral rock is often also dominated by [S. spinulosa] (unit A4.221) but lacks the kelp and red seaweeds.

The stable rock, which can be cobbles or boulders but is more typically bedrock, is usually silted. Individual species of foliose red seaweeds such as [Plocamium cartilagineum] or [Calliblepharis ciliata] often dominate. Other red seaweeds likely to be present include [Phyllophora crispa], [Rhodymenia holmesii], [Halurus flosculosus], [Cryptopleura ramosa], [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides], [Heterosiphonia plumosa] and coralline crusts. The brown seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma] is sometimes present, although never abundant. This biotope does not generally occur below kelp park but rather occurs on shallow, silted rock on which kelp would normally grow in less turbid conditions. The fauna can be variable but is generally typified by the presence of silt-tolerant animals such as encrusting sponges, particularly [Dysidea fragilis] and [Halichondria panicea], the hydroid [Tubularia indivisa], bryozoan crusts and scattered [Sabellaria spinulosa] and [Balanus crenatus]. In the summer months the seaweeds can become heavily encrusted with the bryozoan [Electra pilosa] and the ascidian [Molgula manhattensis] which can also form dense mats on the rock. The polychaete [Lanice conchilega] can be present, where sandy and muddy patches occur. Where this biotope occurs on chalk bedrock, such as off the Sussex coast, the piddock [Pholas dactylus] is often found bored into the rock. This biotope is recorded from the English Channel, off Kent, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. Please notice that individual sites of this biotope can vary significantly in the species composition.Situation: This biotope generally occurs on discrete bedrock outcrops surrounded by areas of mixed sediment or mobile sand. Off Sussex, it occurs on the horizontal chalk bedrock forming the tops of cliffs (2-3m in height).Temporal variation: The seaweeds die back in late autumn and summer leaving, silted, coralline-encrusted rock with a sparse fauna of sponges, [S. spinulosa] and occasional hydroids and bryozoans.

Below this, on bedrock and stable boulders a canopy of mixed kelp (primarily [Laminaria hyperborea] and [Laminaria saccharina]) occurs with foliose red seaweeds, sponges and ascidians (A3.222). This biotope is typically found in the sheltered narrows and sills of Scottish sealochs. Mixed substrata of boulders, cobbles, pebbles and gravel, that also occurs in the tidal rapids of Scottish sealochs, supports a reduced kelp canopy ([L. hyperborea] and [L. saccharina]; typically Frequent), with a rich red seaweed component and maerl at some sites (A3.223). In south-west Britain, sheltered, tide-swept rock is restricted to estuarine conditions where variable salinity and increased turbidity of the water have a significant effect on the biota, limiting the infralittoral zone to very shallow depths. Unlike the tide-swept channels in sealochs, the rock in these estuaries is characterised by a relatively low abundance of [L. saccharina] (< Common) with foliose red seaweeds, sponges and ascidians (A3.224).

Green seaweeds present include [Ulva lactuca, Enteromorpha intestinalis] and [Cladophora rupestris]. The increased water movement encourages several filter-feeding faunal groups to occur. The sponges [Leucosolenia] spp., [Scypha ciliata] and [Hymeniacidon perleve] frequently occur on steep and overhanging rock faces. The bryozoans [Electra pilosa], [Membranoptera membranipora] and [Alcyonidium hirsutum] encrust the kelp and other foliose seaweeds. In addition, ascidians such as [Ascidiella scabra], [Dendrodoa grossularia] and colonial ascidians [Botryllus byssoides] and [Botryllus leachi] often thrive in this environment encrusting both the rock and the seaweeds. The tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] can be found on the rock and on the kelp holdfasts along with the barnacle [Balanus crenatus]. More mobile species such as the gastropods [Gibbula cineraria] and [Calliostoma zizyphinum], the crab [Carcinus maenas] and the starfish [Asterias rubens] are also common. Areas where increased tidal movement influences this community can be found in the narrows and/or intertidal sills of sealochs.Situation: This biotope often occurs immediately below the tide-swept [Fucus serratus] biotope (unit A1.152) consequently, some [F. serratus] may occur in this biotope (typically only Occasional).

Large stands of the brown seaweed [Halidrys siliquosa] may also occur amongst the kelp along with [Dictyota dichotoma] on bedrock and boulders. In contrast to the scoured rock surface the kelp stipes themselves often support prolific growths of foliose red seaweeds such as [Phycodrys rubens, Membranoptera alata, Delesseria sanguinea] and [Plocamium cartilagineum]. Other foliose seaweeds may be present among the kelp holdfasts include [Chondrus crispus] [and Dilsea carnosa]. The scoured rock surface is characterised by encrusting coralline algae, barnacles [Balanus crenatus] and the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter].

The kelp in these tidal rapids does not form the same dense canopies associated with stable tide-swept bedrock, but generally occurs at lower abundance (Frequent). Other brown seaweeds occur in significant amounts in these tidal rapids including [Dictyota dichotoma], [Halidrys siliquosa] and [Chorda filum].

Red seaweeds common to both A3.222 and this biotope include [Chondrus crispus], [Delesseria sanguinea], [Plocamium cartilagineum] and [Phycodrys rubens]. Good examples of this biotope often have maerl gravel ([Lithothamnion] sp.) or rhodoliths between cobbles and boulders. Where maerl dominates, the biotope should be recorded as a maerl bed (unit A5.51). The sponges associated with more stable, tide-swept conditions are generally absent, but the anthozoan [Anemonia viridis] might be present.

Unlike [L. hyperborea], however, [L. ochroleuca] has a smooth stipe and it lacks the epiphytic growth of seaweeds. The bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea] may encrust the very lower part of the stipe but the rest of the stipe is characteristically bare. The fronds too are generally free of encrusting hydroids, bryozoans and grazing gastropods as compared to [L. hyperborea]. [L. ochroleuca] holdfasts, however, are often encrusted with sponges and colonial ascidians. A large variety of foliose and filamentous red seaweeds are often present underneath the canopy. These include [Callophyllis laciniata], [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Cryptopleura ramosa], [Delesseria sanguinea], [Dilsea carnosa Bonnemaisonia asparagoides, Erythroglossum laciniatum, Sphaerococcus coronopifolius, Polyneura bonnemaisonii] and [Corallina officinalis]. The foliose brown seaweed [Dictyota dichotoma] is frequently found in this biotope along with the occasional kelp such as [Saccorhiza polyschides] and [Laminaria saccharina]. The faunal composition of the biotope as a whole is often sparse. The anthozoans [Corynactis viridis] and [Caryophyllia smithii] are common on vertical surfaces with scattered bryozoan turf species such as Crisiidae. Grazers such as the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria] and the urchin [Echinus esculentus] are often present. [L. ochroleuca] occurs across a wide range of wave exposures (in common with [L. hyperborea]) and consequently it occurs at low abundance in other kelp biotopes (sheltered through to exposed) that occur in the South-West between Dorset to Lundy. In such cases, records should be considered as regional variations of the usual kelp biotopes. Records should only be assigned to this biotope when the canopy is dominated by [L. ochroleuca] alone, or by a mixture of both [L. hyperborea] and [L. ochroleuca] (though the latter is usually at greater abundance). [L. ochroleuca] commonly occurs on the Brittany and Normandy coasts.Situation: On moderately exposed to sheltered rock [Laminaria ochroleuca] can form a dense forest below the [L. hyperborea] forest (unit A3.2141).

Other red seaweeds such as encrusting coralline algae, [Phycodrys rubens, Callophyllis laciniata, Bonnemaisonia asparagoides] and [Plocamium cartilagineum] can be present. Other brown seaweeds include [Dictyota dichotoma] and [Desmarestia aculeata]. The animal component of this biotope is generally richer than the upper infralittoral mixed kelp forest (A3.3121). A variety of hydroids such as [Obelia geniculata] grow epiphytically on the kelp fronds along with the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea]. The echinoderm [Antedon bifida] and ascidians such as [Clavelina lepadiformis] attach to the kelp stipes, above the silted rock.

Although both kelp species can occur in equal abundance (Common), [L. hyperborea] usually dominates. The grazing-resistant brown seaweed [Desmarestia aculeata] and [Cutleria multifida] may be present. A similar variety of red seaweeds to those found in the ungrazed kelp forest (A3.3121) may occur beneath the kelp canopy, but in much lower abundance. As grazing intensity increases the seaweed cover decreases - and some sites are reduced to the bare appearance of encrusting brown and coralline algae beneath the kelp canopy. The [L. hyperborea] stipes generally support more seaweeds than the rock beneath, including [Cryptopleura ramosa], [Delesseria sanguinea], [Phycodrys rubens] and [Bonnemaisonia hamifera]. The stipes may also support sometimes dense ascidians [Clavelina lepadiformis] and [Ciona intestinalis] and the echinoderm [Antedon bifida]. The kelp fronds are often densely covered by the hydroid [Obelia geniculata]. At the most intensively grazed sites even the kelp stipes are bare. Although the rock appears bare, between boulders and in crevices there are often the brittlestar [Ophiothrix fragilis] and the crabs [Necora puber] and [Pagurus bernhardus].

"A3.313","5","[Laminaria saccharina] on very sheltered infralittoral rock","Very sheltered infralittoral rock dominated by the kelp [Laminaria saccharina]. Typically very silty and often with few associated seaweeds due to siltation, grazing or shading from the dense kelp canopy. The most commonly occurring red seaweeds are [Delesseria sanguinea], [Phycodrys rubens, Bonnemaisonia hamifera] and coralline crusts. In addition to the kelp the brown seaweed [Chorda filum] and Ectocarpaceae are often present. As well as lacking [Laminaria hyperborea], the A3.313 biotopes have fewer foliose and filamentous red seaweed species by comparison to A3.312 biotopes. A depauperate assemblage of animals is present (by comparison to A3.2141 and A3.2142) predominantly consisting of the encrusting polychaetes [Pomatoceros triqueter], the crabs [Carcinus maenas] and [Pagurus bernhardus] and the ubiquitous gastropod [Gibbula cineraria]. The echinoderms [Antedon bifida], starfish [Asterias rubens], brittlestar [Ophiothrix fragilis] and urchin [Echinus esculentus] occur in low abundance. Ascidians are commonly found in all the A3.313 biotopes, but the large solitary ascidian [Ascidia mentula] are most prolific in very sheltered conditions of [L. saccharina] forests (A3.3132).

Beneath the kelp canopy, the understorey of red seaweeds often includes [Chondrus crispus, Dumontia contorta, Bonnemaisonia hamifera] and [Plocamium cartilagineum]. The surface of the rock is usually covered with encrusting coralline algae as well as non-calcified red crusts and the tube-building polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter]. The brown seaweeds [Chorda filum], Ectocarpaceae and [Fucus serratus] can be present along with the green seaweeds [Ulva lactuca] and [Enteromorpha intestinalis].

Beneath and between boulders a variety of mobile crustaceans such as [Carcinus maenas], the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria] and the starfish [Asterias rubens] are common.Situation: Where hard substrata occur on the shore, this biotope will be found below the [F. serratus] zone (units A1.3151, A1.214 or A1.3152 on mixed substrata). With such sheltered shores, the transition between sublittoral fringe and the true sublittoral zone may not be distinct; this biotope therefore extends into the shallow sublittoral kelp forest below (A3.3121, A3.3121 or A3.314).","",""
"A3.3132","6","[Laminaria saccharina] forest on very sheltered upper infralittoral rock","Sheltered to extremely sheltered sublittoral fringe and infralittoral bedrock, boulders and cobbles characterised by a dense canopy of the kelp [Laminaria saccharina]. In such sheltered conditions, a distinct sublittoral fringe is not always apparent and this biotope can therefore extend from below the [Fucus serratus] zone (A1 315) into the upper infralittoral zone, though there may be a mixed [L. saccharina] and [Laminaria digitata] zone (A3.3131) in between. There is a relatively low species diversity and species density due to a combination of heavy siltation of the habitat and the lack of light penetrating through the dense kelp canopy. Only a few species of red seaweeds are present compared with A3.3131 or A3.312. The most commonly occurring red seaweeds are [Delesseria sanguinea], [Phycodrys rubens], [Bonnemaisonia hamifera] and coralline crusts. Brown seaweeds are also sparse and generally comprise [Chorda filum] and ectocarpoids. At extremely sheltered sites, where there is a heavy silt cover on the rock and the kelp fronds, the sub-flora is reduced to a few specialised species able to tolerate these conditions, such as the cartilaginous seaweeds [Polyides rotundus] and [Chondrus crispus]. Ascidians such as [Clavelina lepadiformis], [Ascidiella aspersa] and [Ascidia mentula] can remain prominent in such conditions, often occurring on steep or vertical rock which is subject to less siltation. The variety of red seaweeds is further reduced where grazers such as the urchin [Echinus esculentus] and the top shell [Gibbula cineraria] are present. The keelworm [Pomatoceros triqueter], the crab [Carcinus maenas] and the hermit crab [Pagurus bernhardus] can be present. Geographical variations: Northern sites: in sheltered sealochs the most conspicuous fauna in these forests are the large solitary ascidians [Ciona intestinalis], [Ascidiella] spp. and [A. mentula] which tend to occur in greater abundance than in the mixed kelp forests (A3.312). In common with mixed forests, echinoderms are consistently present in low abundance: the featherstar [Antedon bifida], common starfish [Asterias rubens], the brittlestar [Ophiothrix fragilis] and the urchin [Echinus esculentus] are typically present. Saddle oysters [Pododesmus patelliformis] and chitons [Tonicella marmorea] can occur in high abundance at some sites. The anthozoan [Anemonia viridis] is often more prevalent at the extremely sheltered sites. The communities of the sheltered voes and sounds of Shetland and Orkney are similar to those present in the mainland sealochs. Southern sites: Sheltered infralittoral rock is not commonly found outside of the fjordic sealochs. In south-west Britain, where sublittoral rock does occur in shallow marine inlets, the waters are more turbid than in the sealochs, generally limiting kelp to the sublittoral fringe zone. Echinoderms are rare or absent from the south-western [L. saccharina] forests. A far greater diversity of red seaweeds is associated with the south-western sites: [Palmaria palmata], [Gracilaria gracilis], [Phyllophora pseudoceranoides], [Cystoclonium purpureum], [Rhodophyllis divaricata], [Ceramium nodulosum] and [Polyneura bonnemaisonii] typically occur.Situation: Although this biotope may occur below a mixed kelp canopy that occupies the sublittoral fringe (units A3.3131 or A3.2111) at some sites it extends directly into the sublittoral fringe and abuts the [F. serratus] zone (A1 315 or A1.3152 on mixed substrata).

Beneath the canopy, the rock is covered by encrusting coralline algae, and the urchin [Echinus esculentus] is often present.

The brown seaweeds [Dictyota dichotoma] and [Cutleria multifida] may be present in low abundance.

The hydroid [Kirchenpauria pinnata], although only rare is often found in the kelp park along with the top shell [Gibbula cineraria] and the barnacle [Balanus crenatus].Situation: [L. saccharina] park can be found below a similar forest (unit A3.3121) where suitable hard substrata exist or on isolated rock exposures surrounded by sediment communities. It may also occur below a zone of mixed [Laminaria hyperborea] and [L. saccharina] forest (A3.312). [L. saccharina] can also form a band below [L. hyperborea] forest (A3.2141) where some shelter from wave-action is afforded with depth ([L. saccharina] is not tolerant of surge), or more likely where [L. hyperborea] has been grazed out (below A3.2143) since [L. saccharina] grows far quicker than [L. hyperborea]. Where such a narrow band occurs it is generally less silted than that found below A3.3121 in much more sheltered conditions.

The red seaweeds, reduced to small tufts through grazing, include [Phycodrys rubens], [Delesseria sanguinea] and [Brongniartella byssoides] and although these seaweeds also occur in unit A3.3122 they are far less frequent in this biotope. Brown seaweeds, such as [Desmarestia viridis], [Chorda filum] and [Cutleria multifida], may be present. Grazing molluscs, such as [Gibbula cineraria] and can be common.

At some sites the filamentous red seaweed [Bonnemaisonia hamifera, Heterosiphonia plumosa] and [Brongniartella byssoides] may carpet the seabed. Ascidians, particularly [Ascidiella aspersa], [Ascidia mentula, Ciona intestinalis] and [Clavelina lepadiformis] thrive well in these conditions. The echinoderms [Antedon bifida, Echinus esculentus] and [Asterias rubens] are often present along with the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria]. An abundant growth of the hydroid [Obelia geniculata] can cover the silted kelp fronds along with the bryozoan [Membranipora membranacea]. The anthozoan [Caryophyllia smithii] can be present among the kelp holdfasts.

"A3.315","5","[Sargassum muticum] on shallow slightly tide-swept infralittoral mixed substrata","Mixed substrata from the sublittoral fringe to 5m below chart datum dominated by the brown seaweed [Sargassum muticum]. This invasive non-native brown seaweed can form a dense canopy on areas of mixed substrata (typically 0-10% bedrock on 90-100% sandy sediment). The substrate on which this [S. muticum]-dominated community is able to develop is highly variable, but particularly prevalent on broken rock and pebbles anchored in sandy sediment. The pebbles, cobbles and broken bedrock provide a substrate for alga such as the kelp [Laminaria saccharina]. During the spring, [S. muticum] has large quantities of epiphytic ectocarpales and may also support some epifauna e.g. the hydroid [Obelia geniculata] commonly found on kelp. The brown seaweed [Chorda filum], which thrives well on these mixed substrata, is also commonly found with [S. muticum] during the summer months. In Strangford Lough, where this biotope occurs, the amphipod [Dexamine spinosa] has been recorded to dominate the epiphytic fauna (this is known to be commonly found in [Zostera] spp. beds). [S. muticum] is also found on hard, bedrock substrates within [L. saccharina] canopies. [S. muticum] plants on hard substrate area, under a dense [L. saccharina] canopy, are typically smaller and at a much lower density, especially where a lush, under-storey exists with red seaweeds such as [Ceramium nodolosum, Gracilaria gracilis, Chylocladia verticillata, Pterosiphonia plumula] and [Polysiphonia elongata] and the green seaweeds [Cladophora sp., Ulva lactuca] and [Bryopsis plumosa]. The anthozoan [Anemonia viridis] and the crab [Necora puber] can be present. More information is necessary to validate this description.Situation: Where there is a greater proportion of bedrock or boulders (15-100%) [L. saccharina] will typically dominate the canopy.

This biotope appears to have a restricted distribution, being known at present only from the sheltered voes of Shetland, some Scottish lagoons and from the harbours of south-west England. These locations suggest the habitat is likely to be subject to reduced salinity conditions (although the habitat data indicate mostly fully marine records). Dense [Codium] spp. can occur at very sheltered sites, on cobbles or boulders, often in dense patches interspersed with filamentous red seaweeds [Bonnemaisonia hamifera], [Antithamnionella spirographidis] and [Ceramium] spp. Where sediment is present the red seaweed [Polyides rotundus] is commonly found along the rock-sediment interface, and the sponge [Dysidea fragilis] often occurs on the rock. Other red seaweeds that may be present include [Chondrus crispus], [Callophyllis laciniata], [Gelidium latifolium], [Corallina officinalis] and coralline crusts. The brown seaweeds [Halidrys siliquosa], [Desmarestia viridis] or [Chorda filum] may be present in high abundance and although kelp [L. saccharina] may occur, it is usually sparse. There are no conspicuous fauna that typify this biotope, though polychaetes such as terebellids and spirorbids may occur. The opisthobranch [Elysia viridis] may be locally abundant on the seaweeds and is known to favour [Codium fragilis] in particular. Large stands of [Codium] sp. (generally Common abundance) are accompanied by red seaweeds such as [G. latifolium], [C. laciniata] and [A. spirographidis] on the rock beneath. Cod has been reported to occur in the shallows of The Fleet, Bembridge Ledges, Pagham Harbour and Jersey (Tittley et al. 1985).

The coralline crusts are typically [Lithothamnion glaciale], while the brown crusts can be [Pseudolithoderma extensum]. Encrusting polychaetes [Pomatoceros triqueter], resistant to the grazing, are also present on most of the rock. The grazing fauna are a significant component of this biotope; large numbers of [P. miliaris] are typically present, although where absent the brittlestar [Ophiothrix fragilis] may occur. Other grazers prevalent on the rock include the chiton [Tonicella marmorea], the limpet [Tectura testudinalis] and the gastropod [Gibbula cineraria]. A combination of grazing pressure and lowered salinity maintains a low diversity of species in this biotope, with foliose and filamentous seaweeds generally absent or reduced to small tufts by grazing. In stark contrast to the range of seaweeds present in the [L. saccharina] forests (A3.3132) the only red seaweed consistently found in this biotope is [Phycodrys rubens]. The range of fauna is similarly low, with a conspicuous absence of hydroids and bryozoans. Bedrock and boulders provide a firm substrate on which ascidians [Ciona intestinalis] and [Ascidia mentula] and the bivalve [Modiolus modiolus] can attach. The crabs [Pagurus bernhardus] and [Carcinus maenas] can usually be found here, though [Necora puber] typically is absent due to the brackish conditions. The starfish [Asterias rubens] along with the whelk [Buccinum undatum] can be present. The substratum on which this biotope occurs varies from bedrock to boulders or cobbles on sediment. The kelp band is relatively narrow and shallow (upper 5 m) compared to unit A3.3121, although the grazed coralline encrusted rock extends deeper. This depth limit becomes shallower towards the heads of the sealochs. Geographical distribution This biotope is restricted to the west coast of Scotland, usually near the head of fjordic sealochs, which are influenced by freshwater run-off.Situation: Where circalittoral rock occurs below this biotope, it often supports a brachiopod/anthozoan community (unit A4.314); where mixed substrata occurs below or adjacent, beds of [Modiolus modiolus] are common (units A5.623 or A5.442).Temporal variation: If the grazing pressure is reduced (i.e. a decrease in the number of grazing echinoderms present) there may be an increase in filamentous and foliose seaweeds although the diversity will remain low compared to full saline sites.","",""

"A4","2","Circalittoral rock and other hard substrata","Circalittoral rock is characterised by animal dominated communities (a departure from the algae dominated communities in the infralittoral zone). The circalittoral zone can itself be split into two sub-zones; upper circalittoral (foliose red algae present but not dominant) and lower circalittoral (foliose red algae absent). The depth at which the circalittoral zone begins is directly dependent on the intensity of light reaching the seabed; in highly turbid conditions, the circalittoral zone may begin just below water level at mean low water springs (MLWS). The biotopes identified in the field can be broadly assigned to one of three energy level categories: high, moderate and low energy circalittoral rock (used to define the habitat complex level). The character of the fauna varies enormously and is affected mainly by wave action, tidal stream strength, salinity, turbidity, the degree of scouring and rock topography. It is typical for the community not to be dominated by single species, as is common in shore and infralittoral habitats, but rather comprise a mosaic of species. This, coupled with the range of influencing factors, makes circalittoral rock a difficult area to satisfactorily classify; particular care should therefore be taken in matching species and habitat data to the classification.","",""

It most frequently occurs between 10-20m water depth. The biotope is exposed to varying amounts of scour (due to nearby patches of sediment) and, as a consequence, is characteristically dominated by dense [Flustra folicaea], a range of colonial ascidians and a variety of other scour/silt-tolerant species. In addition to [F. foliacea], other bryozoans present in this biotope include [Alcyonidium diaphanum], [Bugula flabellata] and [Bugula plumosa]. Varying amounts of the soft coral [Alcyonium digitatum] may be recorded, depending on the amount of scouring which may vary locally. Where scour is a major factor, species such as the scour-tolerant [Urticina felina] are frequently observed.

Sand and silt are periodically re-suspended in the water column, resulting in scour-tolerant species being characteristic of these areas. There is a dense covering of the scour-resistant bryozoan [Flustra foliacea] attached to the bedrock plains and boulders. The colonial ascidian [Polyclinum aurantium] commonly covers the rock surface at most locations within this biotope - itself incorporating sand grains into its surface to give it the appearance of sandy rock nodules. Other ascidians that may occur in this crust are the flat, encrusting colonial [Botrylloides leachi], [Botryllus schlosseri] and the colonial ascidian [Clavelina lepadiformis], although in varying quantities at each location.

It is commonly recorded from the shallower reaches of the circalittoral around depths from 5m to 15m BCD, as it occurs mostly in very turbid waters. From afar, the physical characteristics are usually silted bedrock reefs and cobble, interspersed with patches of clean sand, causing a scour effect on the rock. Dense aggregations of the ascidian [Molgula manhattensis] form a silty mat on the rock and there is a sparse hydroid and bryozoan turf. A hydroid turf, composed of [Nemertesia antennina], [Halecium beanii], [Hydrallmania falcata], [Sertularella gaudichaudi], [Tubularia indivisa] and [Alcyonium digitatum], in varying amounts, occurs at most sites on the tops of boulders and ridges. A bryozoan turf is also present, but not usually dense and includes [Flustra foliacea], [Alcyonidium diaphanum], [Electra pilosa] and the crust-forming bryozoan [Conopeum reticulum]. The polychaete [Lanice conchilega] thrives in the sandy patches which often occur between the rock ridges. The scour effect tends to reduce the diversity of sponges present with only [Halichondria panicea] occasionally present. Isolated clumps of the polychaete [Sabellaria spinulosa] may be present but they do not occur in dense aggregations as in the A4.2211 biotope.

It is found predominantly from 10-30m water depth. From afar, this biotope is mostly distinguished by the frequently occurring seafan [Swiftia pallida], encrusting red algae and the abundant cup coral [Caryophyllia smithii]. This biotope has quite an impoverished appearance, compared with unit A4.133 which has a strong sponge component. Other species present are typically in low abundance.

This often silty biotope has a typically sparse fauna, appearing grazed, and is characterised by common cup corals [Caryophyllia smithii], frequent [Alcyonium digitatum] and occasional urchins [Echinus esculentus]. There may be occasional large growths of the sponge [Cliona celata], [Haliclona viscosa], [Pachymatisma johnstonia] and the axinellid sponge [Stelligera stuposa].

However, the depth at which the variant occurs means that wave action is not so severe on the seabed as to displace the dense mat of brittlestars that covers the seabed. [Ophiothrix fragilis] is usually the most dominant species in shallow water, with [Ophiocomina nigra] usually found amongst them, but sometimes becoming the dominant species in deeper water. Although brittlestar biotopes are typically species-poor, the underlying fauna in this variant is relatively diverse and resembles that of A4.2122. Species such as the anemone [Urticina felina], the cup coral [Caryophyllia smithii], and the anemone [Corynactis viridis] may occasionally be present. There may also be sparse clumps of various hydroids including [Halecium halecinum], [Nemertesia antennina], [Nemertesia ramosa], [Sertularella gayi] and [Abietinaria abietina]. Soft coral [Alcyonium digitatum] is occasionally present and there may be sparse specimens of the sponges [Cliona celata] and [Polymastia boletiformis]. In addition, various echinoderms such as [Asterias rubens], [Antedon bifida], [Echinus esculentus], [Henricia oculata], [Marthasterias glacialis] and [Luidia ciliaris] may be observed.

"A4.2122","6","[Caryophyllia smithii] and sponges with [Pentapora foliacea], [Porella compressa] and crustose communities on wave-exposed circalittoral rock","This variant is typically found on the upper faces and vertical sides of wave-exposed bedrock or boulders subject to moderately strong to weak tidal streams. The fauna is often sparse with the frequently observed [Echinus esculentus] giving it a grazed appearance, but the community may also be affected by violent storm action working into deep water during winter storms. Despite this spartan appearance, the community is relatively diverse and contains a wide range of sponges, hydroids, bryozoans and echinoderms. This variant is found on open coasts or offshore, and is characterised by the cup-coral [Caryophyllia smithii], [Alcyonium digitatum], the sea urchin [Echinus esculentus], large specimens of the sponge [Cliona celata], encrusting bryozoans and encrusting red algae. Although this variant tends to occur in deep water (depth range of 20-30m), a high degree of water clarity allows some red algae to grow at these depths. Other species recorded include large specimens of [Haliclona viscosa], the bryozoans [Parasmittina trispinosa], [Porella compressa] and [Pentapora foliacea], the sea cucumbers [Holothuria forskali] and [Aslia lefevrei] and sparse hydroids such as [Abietinaria abietina], [Nemertesia antennina], [Nemertesia ramosa] and [Halecium halecinum].

"A4.213","5","[Urticina felina] and sand-tolerant fauna on sand-scoured or covered circalittoral rock","This biotope typically occurs on tide-swept circalittoral bedrock, rock adjacent to mobile sand/gravel in gullies, and cobbles on gravel and sand, characterised by scour-tolerant robust species. Although many of these species are found on subtidal rock, they tend to occur in larger numbers in these highly sand-influenced conditions. The dominant species by far is the anemone [Urticina felina] which commonly occurs on rocks at the sand-rock interface, where the scour levels are at a maximum and few species can tolerate this abrasion. The sponge [Ciocalypta penicillus] is also very characteristic of shifting sand-covered rock. This biotope is only occasionally recorded as a separate entity, because its extent is typically restricted to a very narrow band of rock at the sediment interface. Only occasionally does it cover a large extent of rock (e.g. where the wave action is strong enough to cause sand abrasion well up the rock face or where the rock is low-lying). More often, this scoured zone is recorded as part of whatever biotope occurs on the nearby hard substrata. Other species (which are able to survive, and benefit from the reduced competition) include [Balanus crenatus], [Pomatoceros triqueter], [Cellepora pumicosa], [Alcyonidium diaphanum], [Cliona celata], encrusting red algae and [Asterias rubens].Situation: This biotope tends to be found in close proximity to mobile sand or gravel, producing scour that tends to limit the number of species found.","",""

The biotope is dominated by faunal (e.g. [Parasmittina trispinosa]) and algal (Corallinaceae) crusts, and tends to have a grazed appearance; this may be partially attributable to the abundance of [Echinus esculentus] found in this biotope. Occasionally, the rock may appear pink from a distance, due to the expanses of encrusting red algae on the rock surface. [Alcyonium digitatum] is one of the few species to stand erect from the encrusted rock surface and are frequently encountered, on the tops of rocky outcrops and boulders. Hydroids do not form a prominent feature of this biotope, with only robust species such as [Abietinaria abietina] frequently recorded. Sponges and [Caryophyllia smithii] are rarely present while erect bryozoans and ascidians are scarce (although there are exceptions, see variants). The [E. esculentus] grazed substratum may be interspersed with other encrusting species such as the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] and the saddle oyster [Pododesmus patelliformis]. Other species present include [Asterias rubens], [Ophiothrix fragilis], [Urticina felina], [Ophiocomina nigra], [Pagurus bernhardus], [Flustra foliacea], [Gibbula cineraria], [Calliostoma zizyphinum], [Ophiura albida], [Ciona intestinalis] and [Antedon bifida].

"A4.2141","6","[Flustra foliacea] on slightly scoured silty circalittoral rock","This variant is typically found on the upper faces of moderately wave-exposed circalittoral bedrock or boulders subjected to moderately strong tidal streams. These rocky patches may be interspersed with gravelly sand patches, causing a scouring effect. From afar, the variant appears dominated by the bryozoan [Flustra foliacea]. [Alcyonium digitatum] may also be seen attached to the rocky substratum. Under closer inspection, the white tubes of the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] may be observed on the rock and boulders, especially on vertical faces. There may be sandy/gravelly patches in between the boulders colonised by the anemone [Urticina felina]. The regular occurrence of large numbers of the sea urchin [Echinus esculentus] in this biotope may be responsible for grazing the faunal and algal turf, thus keeping species richness relatively low. Other echinoderms that may be seen include the ubiquitous starfish [Asterias rubens] and the common brittlestar [Ophiothrix fragilis]. Sparse clumps of the hydroids [Thuiaria thuja], [Abietinaria abietina], [Nemertesia antennina] and [Tubularia indivisa] are occasionally seen attached to the rocky substratum. The hermit crab [Pagurus bernhardus], the polychaete [Sabella pavonina] and sparse bryozoan crusts may also be present. This biotope is characteristic of the bedrock terraces along the Northumberland coast that are generally species impoverished compared to similar [F. foliacea] biotopes on the west coasts of the UK, which have a more diverse range of sponges, hydroids and bryozoans. As the turbidity levels increase in this fairly silty biotope, so the species diversity is reduced.Situation: This biotope typically occurs around coasts subject to sand scour and siltation. Associated biotopes common around the north-east coast of England include circalittoral gravel and coarse sands. Typical species present include [Echinocardium], [Lanice conchilega], [Ensis] spp., [Mya truncata] and [Myxicola]. Where suitable substratum is available, exposed kelp forests occur in the infralittoral (the latter normally occupies a narrow band due to the high silt loading in the water column). Where this biotope occurs along with chalk or limestone bedrock and boulders, piddock dominated biotopes (Pid) may also be found.","",""

The variant has a very grazed, sparse appearance, dominated only by the presence of [Alcyonium digitatum] and large expanses of encrusting red alage and bryozoan crusts particularly ([Parasmittina trispinosa]). The sparse appearance can be attributed to the frequently observed sea urchin [Echinus esculentus]. The polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter] can be locally abundant, and may in some cases cover far more rock surface than [A. digitatum], especially on vertical faces. Clumps of robust hydroids such as [Abietinaria abietina] occur occasionally.

The rock surface is dominated by [Alcyonium digitatum] and the bryozoan [Securiflustra securifrons]. The rock between these species appears fairly sparse and grazed, with expanses of encrusting red algae. The sea urchin [Echinus esculentus] is frequently seen, and in collaboration with the light attenuating effects of depth, is probably the principal reason for the lack of algal turf.

In fact, they may form such dense beds that the seabed underneath may not be visible. The rocky substratum is usually colonised by species such as encrusting red algae and the white, calcareous tubes of the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter].

The rocky substratum is generally covered with encrusting red algae and the white, calcareous tubes of the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter], dotted with the abundant urchin [Echinus esculentus]. Under closer inspection, [Alcyonium digitatum] are usually seen attached to the rocky surface underneath rock overhangs and large boulders. Although they may be recorded as abundant or common in some areas, their relatively small size means that their biomass is generally lower than in other biotopes. Sparse clumps of robust hydroids such as [Abietinaria abietina] are frequently observed, and bryozoan crusts such as [Parasmittina trispinosa] are occasionally seen. Echinoderms such as the brittlestars [Ophiothrix fragilis] and [Ophiocomina nigra], and the crab [Cancer pagurus] may be seen within crevices in the boulders/rock whilst the starfish [Asterias rubens] may be seen on the rock surface. Muddy-gravel patches between boulders (especially within Scottish sealochs) provide a suitable habitat for the anemone [Urticina felina]. The top shell [Gibbula cineraria] is occasionally seen grazing on the rock surface. Within this biotope, there is some regional variation. The robust hydroid [A. abietina] is typically found in higher abundances in northern (Scottish) regions, especially around the Isle of May.Situation: Above the A4.2145 variant in the infralittoral zone, species such as [Alaria esculenta] and [Laminaria hyperborea] are found in more wave exposed sites (A3.111 / A3.113) while species such as [Laminaria saccharina] may be found above A4.2145 in the more sheltered examples.

Typical species found within these habitats include the anemones [Mesacmaea mitchellii] and [Aureliana heterocera]. When tidal-streams becomes negligible, but with similar wave-sheltered conditions, you tend to find A4.2111 biotopes occurring, especially in the same geographical location (around south-west/west Ireland) as A4.312.","",""
"A4.313","5","[Antedon] spp., solitary ascidians and fine hydroids on sheltered circalittoral rock","This biotope is typically found on silty boulder or rock slopes, in the sheltered parts of sealochs, subject to weak or very weak tidal currents. The seabed consists of smooth, silty bedrock or boulders, often as outcrops on mixed muddy sediment. There are often small vertical faces on the sides of rock ridges, and at few sites, there may be more extensive steep or vertical bedrock. In sharp contrast to the barren, grazed appearance of A4.3111, the species composition of unit A4.313 is quite diverse, although no one phyla dominates. A wide range of encrusting species may be found, including the brachiopod [Neocrania anomala], the saddle oyster [Pododesmus patelliformis], encrusting red algae and polychaetes ([Pomatoceros triqueter] and [Protula tubularia]). Other conspicuous species include crinoids on the tops of boulders ([Antedon bifida], commoner in shallower water and [Antedon petasus], commoner in deeper water), scattered solitary and colonial ascidians ([Ascidia mentula], [Ascidia virginea], [Corella parallelogramma], [Clavelina lepadiformis] and [Ciona intestinalis]) and tufts of fine hydroids ([Kirchenpaueria pinnata], [Nemertesia antennina], [Obelia dichotoma] and [Halceum halecinum]).

Other species recorded are the squat lobster [Munida rugosa], the hermit crab [Pagurus bernhardus] and the chiton [Tonicella marmorea].Situation: The range of biotopes shallower and deeper than A4.313 is typical of a sheltered sealoch. Silted kelp biotopes (e.g. units A3.312, A3.313) are typically found shallower than A4.313 in the infralittoral zone.

In these very sheltered conditions, there are frequently dense populations of the anemone [Protanthea simplex] growing on the silty boulder or rock slope, and on the tubes of the parchment worm [Chaetopterus variopedatus]. The underlying rock surfaces are usually covered with encrusting red algae, the polychaete [Pomatoceros triqueter], the brachiopod [Neocrania anomala], the saddle oyster [Pododesmus patelliformis] and the conspicuous fan worm [Sabella pavonina].

The sea cucumber [Psolus phantapus] may be found on the underside of boulders. Other species such as the hermit crab [Pagurus bernhardus] and the spider crab [Hyas araneus] may be found amongst the rock/boulders. The starfish [Asterias rubens], [Crossaster papposus], and [Henricia] spp. and the sea urchin [Psammechinus miliaris] are also recorded within this variant.

It is possible that this biotope has developed due to chronic sedimentary disturbance in areas where the units A5.261 or A5.242 would normally develop as these biotopes are often found in more sheltered areas adjacent to A5.136.Temporal variation: The importance of the cumacean crustaceans in this biotope is unusual, and their numbers are likely to fluctuate over time; at times of increased disturbance it is likely that C. setosa will become more dominant.","",""
"A5.137","5","Dense [Lanice conchilega] and other polychaetes in tide-swept infralittoral sand and mixed gravelly sand","Dense beds of [Lanice conchilega] occur in coarse to medium fine gravelly sand in the shallow sublittoral, where there are strong tidal streams or wave action. Several other species of polychaete also occur as infauna e.g. [Spiophanes bombyx], [Scoloplos armiger], [Chaetozone setosa] and [Magelona mirabilis]. Lanice beds are found in a wide range of habitats including muddier mixed sediment. The dense [Lanice] biotope (A5.137) on certain lower shores may be a littoral extension of the current biotope. The presence of [L. conchilega] in high numbersmay, over time, stabilise the sediment to the extent where a more diverse community may develop (Wood, 1987). Possibly as a result of this, there is a high level of variation with regard the infauna found in A5.137. It is likely that a number of sub-biotopes may subsequently be identified for this biotope. Offshore from the Wash and the North Norfolk coast [Lanice] beds are often found intermixed with [Sabellaria spinulosa] beds in muddier mixed sediment, particularly in the channels between the shallow sandbanks, which are so prevalent in this area (IECS, 1995; NRA, 1995). It is possible that the presence of [Lanice] has stabilised the habitat sufficiently to allow the deposition of finer material, which has subsequently assisted the development of [S. spinulosa]. It may be more accurate to define A5.137 as an epibiotic biotope which overlays a variety of infaunal biotopes (e.g. A5.233 in finer sands and A5.261 or A5.242 in slightly muddier areas).","",""

The main cover organisms tend to be restricted to calcareous tube worms such as [Pomatoceros triqueter] (or [P. lamarcki)], small barnacles including [Balanus crenatus] and [Balanus balanus], and a few bryozoan and coralline algal crusts. Scour action from the mobile substratum prevents colonisation by more delicate species. Occasionally in tide-swept conditions tufts of hydroids such as [Sertularia argentea] and [Hydrallmania falcata] are present. This biotope often grades into A5.444 which is characterised by large amounts of the above hydroids on stones also covered in [Pomatoceros] and barnacles. The main difference here is that A5.444, seems to develop on more stable, consolidated cobbles and pebbles or larger stones set in sediment in moderate tides. These stones may be disturbed in the winter and therefore long-lived and fragile species are not found.Situation: This biotope is found on exposed open coasts as well as at the entrance to marine inlets.","",""

Other taxa may include Nemertea spp., [Protodorvillea kefersteini, Owenia fusiformis, Spiophanes bombyx] and [Amphipholis squamata] along with amphipods such as [Ampelisca spinipes]. This biotope may also be characterised by the presence of conspicuous venerid bivalves, particularly [Timoclea ovata]. Other robust bivalve species such as [Moerella] spp., [Glycymeris glycymeris] and [Astarte sulcata] may also be found in this biotope. [Spatangus purpureus] may be present especially where the interstices of the gravel are filled by finer particles, in which case, [Gari tellinella] may also be prevalent (Glemarec 1973). Venerid bivalves are often under-sampled in benthic grab surveys and as such may not be conspicuous in many infaunal datasets. Such communities in gravelly sediments may be relatively species-rich and they may also contain epifauna such as [Hydroides norvegicus] and [Pomatoceros lamarcki].

This biotope has previously been described as the Deep [Venus] Community and the Boreal Off-Shore Gravel Association by other workers (Ford 1923; Jones 1950) and may also be part of the Venus community described by Thorson (1957) and in the infralittoral etage described by Glemarec (1973). A5.142 may be quite variable over time and in fact may be closer to a biotope complex in which a number of biotopes or sub-biotopes may yet be defined. For example, Ford (1923) describes a Series A and a Series B characterised by [Echinocardium cordatum-Chamelea gallina] and [Spatangus purpurea-Clausinella fasciata]. Furthermore, mosaics of cobble and lag gravel often contain ridges of coarse gravelly sand and these localised patches are also characterised by robust veneriid and similar bivalves including [Arcopagia crassa, Laevicardium crassum] and others including [Glycymeris glycymeris] (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002).

This biotope may be characterised by a prevalence of [Fabulina fabula] and [Magelona mirabilis] or other species of [Magelona (e.g. [M. filiformis)]. Other taxa, including the amphipod [Bathyporeia] spp. and polychaetes such as [Chaetozone setosa], [Spiophanes bombyx] and [Nephtys] spp. are also commonly recorded. In some areas the bivalve [Spisula elliptica] may also occur in this biotope in low numbers. The community is relatively stable in its species composition, however, numbers of [Magelona] and [F. Fabulina] tend to fluctuate. Around the Scilly Isles numbers of [F. fabulina] in this biotope are uncommonly low whilst these taxa are often found in higher abundances in muddier communities (presumably due to the higher organic content). Consequently it may be better to revise this biotope on the basis of less ubiquitous taxa such as key amphipod species (E.I.S. Rees pers. comm. 2002) although more data is required to test this. A5.242 and A5.133 are collectively considered to be the shallow [Venus] community or boreal off-shore sand association of previous workers (see Petersen 1918; Jones 1950; Thorson 1957). These communities have been shown to correlate well with particular levels of current induced bed-stress (Warwick & Uncles 1980). The Arctic [Venus] Community and Mediterranean [Venus] Community described to the north and south of the UK (Thorson 1957) probably occur in the same habitat and appears to be the same biotope described as the [Ophelia borealis] community in northern France and the central North Sea (Künitzer [et al]. 1992). Sites with this biotope may undergo transitions in community composition. The epibiotic biotopes A5.241 and A5.243 may also overlay this biotope in some areas.","",""
"A5.243","5","[Arenicola marina] in infralittoral fine sand or muddy sand","In shallow fine sand or non-cohesive muddy sand in fully marine conditions (or occasionally in variable salinity) a community characterised by the polychaete [Arenicola marina] may occur. This biotope appears quite faunally sparse. Those other taxa present however, include scavenging crustacea such as [Pagurus bernhardus] and [Liocarcinus depurator], terebellid polychaetes such as [Lanice conchilega] and the burrowing anemone [Cerianthus lloydii]. Occasional [Sabella pavonina] and frequent [Ensis] spp. may also be observed in some areas. The majority of records for this biotope are derived from epifaunal surveys and consequently there is little information available for the associated infaunal species. It is possible that this biotope, like unit A5.241 (to which it is broadly similar) is an epibiotic overlay on other biotopes from the A5.2 complex.Temporal variation: At certain times of the year a diatom film may be present on the sediment surface.","",""
"A5.244","5","[Spisula subtruncata] and [Nephtys hombergii] in shallow muddy sand","In shallow non-cohesive muddy sands, in fully marine conditions, a community characterised by the bivalve [Spisula subtruncata] and the polychaete [Nephtys hombergii] may occur. The sediments in which this community is found may vary with regard silt content but they generally have less than 20% silt/clay and in some areas may contain a degree of shell debris. This biotope falls somewhere between A5.242 and A5.261 with regard sediment type (i.e. somewhat muddier than A5.242 and less muddy than A5.261) and may have species in common with both. As a result, other important species in this community include [Abra alba], [Fabulina fabula] spp. and [Mysella bidentata] spp. In addition, [Diastylis rathkei/typical], [Philine aperta] (in muddier sediments), [Ampelisca] spp., [Ophiura albida], [Phaxas pellucidus] and occasionally [Bathyporeia] spp, may also be important, although this is not clear from the data available. In areas of slightly coarser, less muddy sediment [S. solida] or [S. elliptica] may appear occasionally in this biotope. Abundances of [Spisula subtruncata] in this biotope are often very high and distinguish it from other closely related biotopes. Extensive areas of this community to the north east of the Dogger Bank were recorded in the 1950s, but these seem to have declined since then (Kroncke 1990). More information is required with regard the status of this biotope.Temporal variation: In some areas this biotope may be a temporal variant or sub-biotope of A5.242 and A5.261 rather than an established biotope in itself. For example A5.244 has been recorded in Red Wharf Bay and Conwy Bay where it appears to be short term variant of other more established biotopes (e.g. A5.261) and appears to have only intermittent occurrence in single age cohort patches possibly due to predation in some areas (e.g. Red Wharf Bay) by the common Scoter [Melanitta nigra] (E.I.S.

In the most sheltered examples of this biotope a diverse muddy sediment infauna can be found and the [Trailliella] phase of [Bonnemaisonia hamifera] may develop (A5.5214).","",""
"A5.5211","6","Red seaweeds and kelps on tide-swept mobile infralittoral cobbles and pebbles","Shallow mixed substrata of cobbles and pebbles swept by moderately strong tidal streams in exposed areas, and characterised by dense stands of red seaweeds. Tide-swept infralittoral cobbles and pebbles which may be highly mobile, create an environment that is difficult for many algae to survive in. Foliose and filamentous seaweeds with an encrusting phase in their life history, or those that are able to withstand rolling of the substratum and scouring, can form dense turfs of seaweed in the more settled summer months. Characteristic red seaweeds include [Halarachnion ligulatum] which is able to survive attached to the pebbles and cobbles. Ephemeral algae grow rapidly in periods of relative stability. Other characteristic red seaweeds include [Plocamium cartilagineum], [Hypoglossum hypoglossoides], [Bonnemaisonia asparagoides] and [Brongniartella byssoides]. Coralline encrusting algae cover many of the cobbles and pebbles; some areas of cobbles may be quite barren, dominated only by encrusting coralline algae and brittlestars. Of the brown seaweeds scattered [Laminaria] spp. and [Desmarestia] spp. may be present on more stable large boulders or bedrock outcrops. [Chorda filum] and [Halidrys siliquosa] may be present in low abundance but where these seaweeds occur in greater abundance (typically >Frequent) refer to A3.123 and A3.126 respectively. Although the faunal component of this biotope is usually relatively sparse it can include a wide variety of species. Turfs of hydroids ([Nemertesia] spp., [Aglaophenia tubulifera]) and bryozoans ([Crisia] spp. and [Bugula] spp.) are the major components but sponges and anemones may also occur. Brittlestars, sea-urchins, hydroids and solitary ascidians are more prominent in the Scottish examples of this biotope, which tend to occur in deeper water, due in part to clearer waters.Situation: Although not common, this biotope is widely distributed from Sussex to the shallow areas of the Sarns in Cardigan Bay, the west coast of Scotland and the north-east coast of Ireland. Despite the wide distribution, the red seaweed composition remains remarkably constant. In areas such as the Sarns, in Wales, where mixed substrata continue into the shallows, dense swathes of A3.123 can be found. More stable but highly scoured areas adjacent to A5.5211 can support the [Halidrys] biotope A3.126. Where bedrock or large boulders occur above the mixed substrata of A5.5211 it may support a kelp forest or park (A3.115 or A3.214). At many sites the mixed substrata supporting the dense seaweed turf gives way to sediment of varying composition.Temporal variation: This biotope will take on a much more depauperate appearance during the winter months, once the ephemeral seaweeds have died back in late summer/autumn. Storms can mobilise the loose pebbles and cobbles, removing all but the most resilient of seaweeds and animals. By summer, under more stable conditions, new growth will flourish and dense stands of seaweeds dominate the seabed.","",""

The reefs formed by [Sabellaria] consolidate the sediment and allow the settlement of other species not found in adjacent habitats leading to a diverse community of epifaunal and infauna species. The development of such reefs is assisted by the settlement behaviour of larval [Sabellaria] which are known to selectively settle in areas of suitable sediment and particularly on existing [Sabellaria] tubes (Tait and Dipper, 1997; Wilson 1929). These reefs are particularly affected by dredging or trawling and in heavily dredged or disturbed areas an impoverished community may be left (e.g. A5.143) particularly if the activity or disturbance is prolonged. However, it is likely that reefs of [S. spinulosa] can recover quite quickly from short term or intermediate levels of disturbance as found by Vorberg (2000) in the case of disturbance from shrimp fisheries and recovery will be accelerated if some of the reef is left intact following disturbance as this will assist larval settlement of the species.Situation: [S. spinulosa] reefs are often found in areas with quite high levels of natural sediment disturbance.Temporal variation: In some areas the reefs are periodically destroyed by storm events leading to a cyclical shift in biotopes from A5.611 to other biotopes e.g. A5.143 or A5.261 with re-establishment of the [Sabellaria] colonies in the following year.","",""

"A6.611","5","Deep-sea [Lophelia pertusa] reefs","Lophelia pertusa, a cold water, reef-forming coral, has a wide geographic distribution ranging from 55°S to 70°N, where water temperatures typically remain between 4-8°C. These reefs are generally subject to moderate current velocities (0.5 knots). The majority of records occur in the north-east Atlantic. The extent of L. pertusa reefs vary, with examples off Norway several km long and more than 20m high. These reefs occur within a depth range of 200->2000m on the continental slope, and in shallower waters in Norwegian fjords and Swedish west coast.

"A6.62","4","Deep-sea sponge aggregations","Deep sea sponge aggregations are principally composed of sponges from two classes: [Hexactinellida] and [Desmospongia]. They are known to occur between water depths of 250 m to 1300 m (Bett & Rice, 1992), where the water temperature ranges from 4-10°C and there is moderate current velocity (0.5 knots). Deep sea sponge aggregations may be found on soft substrata or hard substrata, such as boulders and cobbles which may lie on sediment. Iceberg plough-mark zones provide an ideal habitat for sponges because stable boulders and cobbles, exposed on the seabed, provide numerous attachment/settlement points (B. Bett, pers comm.). However, with 3.5 kg of pure siliceous spicule material per m2 reported from some sites (Gubbay, 2002), the occurrence of sponge fields can alter the characteristics of surrounding muddy sediments. Densities of occurrence are hard to quantify, but sponges in the class [Hexactinellida] have been reported at densities of 4-5 per m2, whilst `massive¿ growth forms of sponges from the class [Desmospongia] have been reported at densities of 0.5 to 1 per m2 (B. Bett, pers comm.). Deep sea sponges have similar habitat preferences to cold-water corals, and hence are often found at the same location. Research has shown that the dense mats of spicules present around sponge fields may inhibit colonisation by infaunal animals, resulting in a dominance of epifaunal elements (Gubbay, 2002). Sponge fields also support ophiuroids, which use the sponges as elevated perches.","",""

"A6.72","4","Seamounts, knolls and banks","Seamounts are defined as undersea mountains, with a crest that rises more than 1,000 m above the surrounding sea floor (Menard, 1964 in Rogers, 1994). Seamounts can be a variety of shapes, but are generally conical with a circular, elliptical or more elongate base. Seamounts are volcanic in origin, and are often associated with seafloor `hot-spots¿; thinner areas of the earth¿s crust where magma can escape. Seamounts, often with a slope inclination of up to 60°, provide a striking contrast to the surrounding `flat¿ abyssal plain. Their relief has profound effects on the surrounding oceanic circulation, with the formation of trapped waves, jets, eddies and closed circulations known as Taylor columns (Taylor, 1917 in Rogers, 1994). Seamounts occur frequently within the OSPAR Maritime Area. Analysis of narrow beam bathymetric data by the US Naval Oceanographic office from 1967-1989 identified more than 810 seamounts within the North Atlantic. The majority occur along the Mid-Atlantic ridge between Iceland and the Hayes fracture zone (Gubbay, 2002).The enhanced currents that occur around seamounts provide ideal conditions for suspension feeders. Gorgonian, scleratinian and antipatharian corals may be particularly abundant, and other suspension feeders such as sponges, hydroids and ascidians are also present. Concentrations of commercially important fish species, such as [Hoplostethus atlanticus] (orange roughy), aggregate around seamounts and live in close association with the benthic communities (Gubbay, 2002).","",""

The cold-water reef-building corals [Lophelia pertusa] and [Madrepora oculata], as well as echiuran worms are characteristic fauna of carbonate mounds. Where cold-water corals (such as [Lophelia]) are present on the mound summit, coral debris may form a significant component of the overlying substratum.There is currently speculation on the origin of carbonate mounds, with possible associations with fault-controlled methane seepage from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs, or gas-hydrate dissociation (Henriet et al, 1998) through to the debris from `cold-water¿ coral colonies such as [Lophelia].","",""

The water may trickle out from cracks and crevices on the seabed as hot springs (5-250°C), or as very concentrated jets of superheated water (270-380°C). As these concentrated jets of water cool, minerals dissolved in the water precipitate out in black clouds, giving them their common name of `black smokers¿. At lower temperatures, sulphides are mostly precipitated within the rocks, making the venting fluids appear cloudier. These are known as `white smokers¿ (Gage & Tyler, 1991). Hydrothermal vent fields cover relatively small areas of the seabed in water depths of 850 - 4000 m. The biological communities associated with hydrothermal vents are unusual as they are able to derive energy under conditions where photosynthesis is not possible. These habitats contain a huge diversity of chemoautotrophic bacteria, which form the core of the trophic structure around the vent. Characteristic species include the giant vent clam [Calyptogena magnifica], the mussel [Bathymodiolus thermophilus], the tube worm [Riftia pachyptila], the crabs [Cyanograea praedator] and [Bythograea thermydron] and the shrimp [Charocaris fortunate].","",""

This humification only affects the top 2 or 3 centimetres and disappears quickly under the action of the sun; at depth, the sand is damp because of the proximity of the fairly unsalty ground water.","",""

"B3.11","4","Lichens or small green algae on supralittoral and littoral fringe rock","Lichen communities typically form a distinct zone or band in a splash zone on most rocky shores. This splash zone occurs above the main intertidal zone (i.e. that subject to regular covering by the tide) and blends into angiosperm-dominated communities of coastal (terrestrial) habitats at its upper limits. The width of the splash zone varies considerably, depending on the degree of exposure of the shore to wave action. On very exposed coasts the zone is very wide, extending 10s of meters up cliffs, whilst in very sheltered sites it may be only a metre or so high. Several biotopes have been identified. Yellow and grey lichens such as [Xanthoria parietina], [Caloplaca marina], [Caloplaca thallincola] or [Ramalina] sp. dominate the supralittoral rock (B3.111) with the distinctive black band of [Verrucaria maura] occurring below in the littoral fringe (B3.1131, B3.1132). Small green seaweeds can sometimes be found in this splash zone, where localised conditions allow growth in what would otherwise be inhospitable conditions for seaweeds. Such an example is the green seaweed [Prasiola stipitata] which occurs in areas of nitrate enrichment from nearby roosting seabirds (B3.112). The littoral fringe on soft rock can be characterised by the green seaweed [Blidingia minima] (B3.114) while steep and vertical rock influenced by freshwater in the littoral fringe can be dominated by the green seaweeds [Ulothrix flacca], [Urospora penicilliformis] and [Urospora wormskioldii] (B3.115). The winkle [Littorina saxatilis] is one of the few marine species found in this environment.Situation: This habitat type is found in the littoral fringe and the supralittoral zone on all rocky shores if there is sufficient seawater spray to maintain a viable community.","",""
"B3.111","5","Yellow and grey lichens on supralittoral rock","Vertical to gently sloping bedrock and stable boulders in the supralittoral (or splash zone) of the majority of rocky shores are typically characterised by a diverse maritime community of yellow and grey lichens, such as [Xanthoria parietina], [Caloplaca marina], [Lecanora atra] and [Ramalina] spp. The black lichen [Verrucaria maura] is also present, but usually in lower abundance than in the littoral fringe zone. In wave exposed conditions, where the effects of sea-spray extend further up the shore, the lichens generally form a wide and distinct band. This band then becomes less distinct as wave exposure decreases, and in sheltered locations, cobbles and pebbles may also support the biotope. Pools, damp pits and crevices in the rock are occasionally occupied by winkles such as [Littorina saxatilis] and halacarid mites may also be present.Situation: This biotope is usually found at the top of the shore, immediately above a zone of the black lichen [V. maura] (B3.1131, B3.1132). Above the band of B3.111, and occasionally in crevices in the rock alongside the lichens, terrestrial plants such as the thrift [Armeria maritima] and other angiosperms often occur. In sheltered areas the transition from B3.111 to B3.1132 is often indistinct and a mixed zone of B3.111 and B3.1132 may occur. In estuaries, this biotope is often restricted to artificial substrata such as sea defences.","",""

In damp pits and crevices, species such as the winkle [Littorina saxatilis], amphipods and halacarid mites are occasionally found. B3.112 often covers a smaller area than 5m x 5m and care should be taken to notice/record this biotope. The biotope can be associated with artificial substrata such as septic tanks, and in supralittoral areas influenced by sewage seeps or agricultural run-off.Situation: This biotope is found at the top of rocky shores in the splash zone below colonies of nesting or roosting birds growing. B3.112 may also be found at the entrances to and on the ceilings of littoral caves or in patches on large boulders, where birds may be roosting. It can be found in the B3.111 or B3.1132 zones.Temporal variation: [P. stipitata] reaches its maximum abundance during the winter months.

Winkles [Littorina saxatilis] and [Melarhaphe neritoides] are usually present although [M. neritoides] tends to be found on more exposed shores. The limpet [Patella vulgata] is often present though at a low abundance (Occasional). This biotope can be dominated by ephemeral seaweeds including the red seaweed [Porphyra umbilicalis], the green seaweeds [Enteromorpha] spp. or, particulary in the north, microscopic blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae), which overgrow [V. maura]. The wrack [Pelvetia canaliculata] (Rare) may also be present, becoming increasingly more common with greater shelter (see A1.211). Geographical variation: On northern and eastern shores the barnacle is usually [S. balanoides], which is normally restricted to the lower littoral fringe, with a band of [V. maura] only in the upper littoral fringe. On south-west and western shores the barnacle is usually [C. montagui] which may extend over the whole of the littoral fringe zone.Situation: B3.1131 is usually found on more exposed coasts below the [V. maura] biotope B3.1132.

During warm weather [P. umbilicalis] is often bleached light brown and sticks to the rock as it dries out. On southern shores it may be absent during the summer on all but the most exposed shores, as it dies back leaving a barnacle and lichen dominated community. In the cooler north the [P].

"D1.1","3","Raised bogs","The mire surface and underlying peat of highly oligotrophic, strongly acidic peatlands with a raised centre from which water drains towards the edges. The peat is composed mainly of sphagnum remains. Raised bogs form on nearly flat ground and derive moisture and nutrients only from rainfall (ombrotrophic). Raised bog complexes (X04) include larger bog pools (C1.46) and a marginal lagg (C1.47), as well as the main mire surface (D1.1), which in actively-growing raised bogs typically comprises a complex of low hummocks, small pools and their associated vegetation. Raised bogs form only in cool climates with high rainfall. They are most widespread in the boreal zone and in the mountains and hills of the nemoral zone; they occur locally in the lowlands of the nemoral zone. They are characteristic of lowlands and hills of northwestern and northern Europe, the adjacent Hercynian ranges, the Jura, the Alps and the Carpathians.

Such communities are listed in units D1.1114 to D1.1116, as well as in D1.114 and in D1.121; in some of them sphagna may be scarce or replaced by bryopsid mosses. Well-defined sphagnum hummocks of unit D1.1111 may nevertheless develop in conjunction with them.

In particular, the relative abundance of the main constituent grass species, [Bromus erectus], [Brachypodium pinnatum] [s. l]., [Sesleria albicans] and [Koeleria pyramidata], varies both geographically with climatic conditions and locally with topography and agropastoral regime.

In addition to herbs, they can also be colonised by shrubs creating thickets (e.g. [Tamarix] spp.). Where the tidal currents are faster than flood tides, most sediments deposit to form a delta at the mouth of the estuary.

"X3.4","3","Anchihaline caves","Caves which are usually coastal, with different salinities in their water-body profile, from freshwater at the water surface to saline water (usually sea water) on the bottom, with biocenoses typical for each of them. They are influenced by outside climatic conditions and to differing extents by the sea. They occur on karstic substrates and are inhabited by specific communities of anchihaline stygobionts, e.g. copepods [Acanthocyclops gordani], [Diacyclops antrincola], thermosbaenaceans (crustaceans) [Monodella argentarii] and amphipods [Hadzia fragilis], [Niphargus hebereri], [Niphargus pectencoronatae], [Niphargus salonitanus], [Pseudoniphargus adriaticus], [Rhipidogammarus karamani], [Salentinella angelieri].","",""
